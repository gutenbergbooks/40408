<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstwords">The</span> cathedral was crammed. The tall
slender arches seemed to spring out of a
vast sea of human heads. The orchestra
and chorus had gradually merged into one
person: one shout of praise, one voice of
prayer, one wail of terror. The <i>Elijah</i>
was in mid-career, sailing like a man-of-war
upon the rushing waves of music.</p>

<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>

<p>And presently there was a hush, and
out of the hush a winged voice arose,
as a lark rises out of a meadow, singing as
it rises:</p>

<p>'O rest in the Lord, wait patiently for
Him, and He shall give thee thy heart's
desire.'</p>

<p>The lark dropped into its nest again.
The music swept thundering upon its way,
and a large tear fell unnoticed from a
young girl's eyes on to the bare slim hand
which held her score. The score quivered;
the slender willowy figure quivered in its
setting of palest violet and white draperies
threaded with silver. Only a Frenchwoman
could have dared to translate a
child's posy of pale blue and white violets,
tied with a silver string, into a gown;
but Sibyl Carruthers' dressmaker was an
artist in her way, and took an artist's<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>
license, and the half-mourning which she
had designed for the great heiress was
in colouring what a bereaved butterfly
might have worn.</p>

<p>Miss Carruthers was called beautiful.
Perhaps she was beautiful for an heiress,
but she was certainly not, in reality, any
prettier than many hundreds of dowerless
girls who had never been considered more
than good-looking.</p>

<p>Her delicate features were too irregular,
in spite of their obvious high breeding;
her figure was too slight; her complexion
was too faintly tinted for regular beauty.
But she had something of the evanescent
charm of a four-petalled dog-rose newly
blown&mdash;exquisite, ethereal, but as if it might
fall in a moment. This aspect of fragility
was heightened by what women noticed
about her first, namely, her gossamer<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>
gown with its silver gleam, and by what
men noticed about her first&mdash;her gray
eyes, pathetic, eager, shy by turns, always
lovely, but hinting of a sword too sharp
for its slender sheath, of an ardent spirit
whose grasp on this world was too slight.</p>

<p>And as the music passed over her young
untried soul, she sat motionless, her hands
clasping the score. She heard nothing of
it, but it accompanied the sudden tempest
of passion which was shaking her, as wind
accompanies storm.</p>

<p>The voice of the song had stirred an
avalanche of emotion.</p>

<p>'And I will give thee thy heart's desire.'</p>

<p>She knew nothing about waiting
patiently, but her heart's desire&mdash;she
must have it. She could not live without
it. Her whole soul went out in an agony
of prayer to the God who gives and who
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>withholds to accord her this one petition&mdash;to
<i>be his wife</i>. She repeated it over and
over again. To be near him, to see him
day by day&mdash;nothing else, nothing else!
This one thing, without which, poor child!
she thought she could not live. It seemed
to Sibyl that she was falling at God's
feet in the whirlwind, and refusing to let
Him go until He granted her prayer.
But would He grant it? Her heart sank.
Despair rushed in upon her like a flood
at the bare thought of its refusal, and she
caught yet again at the only hope left to
her&mdash;a desperate appeal to the God who
gives and who withholds.</p>

<p>Presently it was all over, and they were
going out.</p>

<p>'We were to wait for the others here,'
said Peggy, the girl who had been sitting
with Sibyl, as they emerged into the sun<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>shine
with the crowd. 'Mother and Mr.
Doll were just behind us.'</p>

<p>Lady Pierpoint, Sibyl's aunt, presently
joined them with Mr. Doll Loftus, an
irreproachable-looking, unapproachable-looking
fair young man, who, it was
whispered, was almost too smart to live,
but who nevertheless bore himself with
severe simplicity.</p>

<p>He went up to Sibyl with some diffidence.</p>

<p>'You are tired,' he said anxiously.</p>

<p>Doll's remarks were considered <i>banal</i>
in the extreme by some women, but others
who admired fair hair and pathetic eyes
found a thoughtful beauty in them.</p>

<p>It would be difficult from her manner
to infer which class of sentiments this
particular remark awoke in Sibyl.</p>

<p>'Music always tires me,' she replied,<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>
without looking at him, dropping her white
eyelids.</p>

<p>'Are we all here?' said Lady Pierpoint.
'Peggy, and Sibyl&mdash;my dear, how tired
you look!&mdash;and myself, and you, Mr.
Doll; that is only four, and "we are
seven." Ah! here come Mr. and Mrs.
Cathcart. Now we only want Mr. Loftus.'</p>

<p>'The Dean caught him in the doorway,'
said Doll. 'He is coming now.'</p>

<p>The tall thin figure of an elder man was
slowly crossing the angular patch of sunshine
where the cathedral had not cast its
great shadow. The nobility of his bearing
seemed to appeal to the crowd. They
made way for him instinctively, as if he
were some distinguished personage. He
was accompanied by a robust clerical
figure with broad calves.</p>

<p>'Mr. Loftus makes everyone else look
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>common,' said Peggy plaintively. 'It is
the only unkind thing I know about him.
I thought the Dean quite dignified-looking
while we were at luncheon at the Deanery,
but now he looks like a pork-butcher.
I'm not going to walk within ten yards of
Mr. Loftus, mummy, or I shall be taken
for a parlourmaid having her day out. I
think, Sibyl, you are the only one who
can afford to go with him.'</p>

<p>But Doll thought differently, and it was
he and Sibyl who walked the short distance
to the station together through the flag-decked
streets in the brilliant September
sunshine. People turned to glance at
them as they passed. They made a
striking-looking couple. Mr. Loftus, following
slowly at a little distance with
Lady Pierpoint, looked affectionately at
the back of his young cousin, who was<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>
also his heir, and said to her, with a
smile:</p>

<p>'I wish it could be. Doll is a good
fellow.'</p>

<p>'I wish indeed it could,' said Lady
Pierpoint earnestly, with the slight slackening
of reserve which is often observable in
the atmosphere on the last afternoon of a
visit with a purpose.</p>

<p>Lady Pierpoint had not come to spend
a whole week with a Sunday in it with
Mr. Loftus at Wilderleigh for nothing.
And she was aware that neither had she
and her niece and daughter been invited
for that long period without a cause. But
the week ended with the following morning,
and she sighed. She had daughters
of her own coming on, as well as her dear
snub-nosed Peggy, who was already out,
and it was natural to wish that the re<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>sponsibility
of this delicate, emotional
creature, with her great wealth, might be
taken from her and placed in safe hands.
She thought Doll was safe. Perhaps the
wish was father, or rather <i>aunt</i>, to the
thought. But it was no doubt the truest
epithet that could be applied to the young
man. It was a matter of opinion whether
he was exhaustingly dull in conversation or
extraordinarily interesting, but he certainly
was safe. He belonged to that class of
our latter-day youth of whom it may be predicted,
with some confidence, that they will
never cause their belongings a moment's
uneasiness; who may be trusted never to
do anything very right or very wrong;
who will get on tolerably well in any
position, and with any woman, provided
there are means to support it and&mdash;<i>her</i>;
who have enough worldliness to marry<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>
money, and enough good feeling to make
irreproachable husbands afterwards; in
short, the kind of young men who are
invented by Providence on purpose to
marry heiresses, and who, if they fall
below their vocation, dwindle, when their
youth is over, into the padded impecunious
bores of society.</p>

<p>There was a short journey by rail
through the hop country. Sibyl watched
the rows of hops in silence. Cowardice
has its sticking-point as well as courage,
and she was undergoing the miserable
preliminary tremors by which that point
is reached. Mr. Loftus, sitting opposite
her, and observing her fixity of gaze,
glanced at her rather wistfully from time
to time. He saw something was working
in her mind. He looked tired, and in the
strong afternoon light his grave, lined<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>
face seemed more worn and world-weary
than ever. He had the look of a man
who had long outlived all personal feeling,
and who to-day had been remembering
his youth.</p>

<p>The Wilderleigh omnibus and Doll's
spider-wheeled dogcart were waiting at
the little roadside station, which was so
small that the train very nearly overlooked
it, and had to be backed. Doll was already
holding the wheel to protect Sibyl's gown
as she got up, and looking towards her,
and Lady Pierpoint was hurrying Peggy,
who had expressed a hankering after the
dogcart, into the omnibus, when Mr.
Loftus observed that he thought he would
walk up.</p>

<p>Sibyl's face changed.</p>

<p>'May I walk up with you?' she asked
instantly.</p>

<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>

<p>Mr. Loftus looked disappointed; everybody
looked disappointed. Lady Pierpoint
put her head out, and said:</p>

<p>'My dear child, the drive in the open
air will refresh you; you are looking tired.'</p>

<p>'May I go in the dogcart if Sibyl
doesn't want to?' put in Peggy in an
audible aside to her mother.</p>

<p>'I think you are tired,' said Mr. Loftus,
looking at Sibyl and shaking his head.
'And,' he added in a lower voice, 'Doll
will be much disappointed.'</p>

<p>A faint colour covered her face, which
quivered as she turned it towards him.</p>

<p>'Let me walk up with you,' she said
again, with a tremor in her voice.</p>

<p>He met her appealing eyes with gentle
scrutiny.</p>

<p>'It is not far,' he said aloud; 'not more
than half a mile through the park. I will<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>
take care of her, Lady Pierpoint. We
shall be at Wilderleigh almost as soon as
you are.'</p>

<p>'Oh, mummy, may I go in the dogcart
<i>now</i>?' implored Peggy from the depths of
the omnibus.</p>

<p>And Mr. Loftus and Sibyl set out
together.</p>

<p>They were in the park in a few minutes,
and were walking down towards Wilderleigh,
on the opposite side of the river, an
old house of weather-beaten gray stone, of
twisted chimneys and uneven roofs and
pointed gables, with quaint carved finials,
standing above its terraces and its long
stone balustrade. The sun was setting in
a sky of daffodil behind the tall top-heavy
elms of the rookery and the tower of the
village church. Little fleets of clouds lay
motionless in high heaven, looking towards<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>
the west. The land in its long shadows
dreamed of peace. The old house beyond
the river was in shadow already. So was
the river.</p>

<p>'Sometimes,' said Mr. Loftus to himself,
'a young girl feels more able to confide in
an old friend than a relation. She has
often talked to me before. Perhaps she
is going to do so again.' And he felt
comforted about Doll and the dogcart.</p>

<p>Presently as he glanced at her, wondering
at her continued silence, he saw that she
was greatly agitated.</p>

<p>'Something troubles you,' he said gently.</p>

<p>She looked at him half in terror, as if
deprecating his anger.</p>

<p>They were walking down a narrow ride
in the tall bracken. A trunk of a tree
lay near the path among the yellowing
fern.</p>

<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>

<p>He led her to it and sat down by her,
looking at her with painful anxiety and
with a sense of growing fatigue. Emotion
of any kind exhausted him. If it had not
been for Doll, he would have dropped the
subject, but for his sake he made an
effort.</p>

<p>'Tell me,' he said, and he took her thin
young hand and held it in his thin older
hand. It was the last afternoon; both
were conscious of it.</p>

<p>She trembled very much, but she did
not speak. His heart sank.</p>

<p>'You wish to tell me something about
Doll, perhaps,' he said at last. 'Do not be
afraid of paining me by talking of it. You
like him, perhaps, but not enough, and you
are grieved because you see how much he
loves you. Is that it?'</p>

<p>'I don't like him,' gasped Sibyl. 'I have<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>
never thought about it. That is only
Aunt Marion.'</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus sighed, and his gray cheek
blanched a little. He had built much on
the hope of this marriage. He had a
tender regard for Sibyl, whose emotional
and impulsive nature appealed to him, and
filled him with apprehension as for a
butterfly in a manufactory, which may
injure itself any moment. And he knew
Doll was genuinely in love with her. It
would be grievous if she were married for
her money. And Wilderleigh was dying
stone by stone and acre by acre for want
of that money.</p>

<p>As he looked mournfully at Sibyl, an
expression came into her wide eyes like
that which he had seen in the eyes of some
timid wild animal brought to bay. He
recognised that, like a shy bird near its<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>
nest, she was defending in impotent despair
of broken white wings something which
was part of her life, which was going from
her, which <i>he</i> was taking away.</p>

<p>'It is you I love,' she said, and her
small hand ceased trembling and became
cold in his.</p>

<p>For a moment both were stunned alike,
and then some of the grayness of age and
suffering crept suddenly from his face to
hers as she felt his hand involuntarily
slacken its clasp of hers.</p>

<p>'My child,' he said at last, with great
difficulty and with greater tenderness, 'it
is very many years since I gave up all
thought of marriage. I am old enough
to be your&mdash;&mdash;' He might have said
'grandfather' with truth. He meant to
say it, but as he approached the word he
could not wound her with it.</p>

<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>

<p>'I know,' she interrupted hurriedly. 'I
don't mind. That is nothing to me.'</p>

<p>'And my life,' he said, 'what little there
is left of it, hangs by a thread.'</p>

<p>'I know,' she said again&mdash;'I have thought
of that. I have thought of nothing but
you since I first met you a year ago. But
if I might only love and serve you and
be with you! And I am so rich, too.
If I might only take away those money
troubles which you once spoke of long
ago! If I might only give you everything
I have! The money is the smallest part
of it&mdash;oh, such a little, little part compared
to&mdash;&mdash;' And she looked imploringly
at him.</p>

<p>He was deeply moved.</p>

<p>'My child,' he said again, and the
ominous repetition of the word shook her
fragile edifice of hopes to its brittle<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>
foundation, 'you have always looked upon
me as a friend, have you not?'</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>'Well, then,' he added, correcting
himself, 'as one who cared for and understood
you, and whose earnest wish was to
see you happy?'</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>He had known difficult hours, but none
more difficult than this. He felt as if he
were trying with awkward hands to hold a
butterfly without injuring it, in order to
release it from the pane of glass against
which it was beating its butterfly heart
out.</p>

<p>'To see you happy,' he went on, with
authority as well as tenderness in his level
voice. 'I should never see that; I should
have no real'&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;'affection
for you at all if I allowed you to make<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>
such a woeful mistake in your early youth
before you know what love and life are.
They are terrible things, Sibyl; I have
known them. This beautiful generous
feeling which you have for me is not love,
and I should be base indeed to allow you
to wreck your life upon it, your youth
upon the rock of my age. You offer you
know not what; you would sacrifice you
know not what.' He smiled gravely at
her, endeavouring to soothe her growing
agitation. 'It would be like taking the
Koh-i-Noor out of the hand of a child. I
could not do it.'</p>

<p>Her mind was in too great a tumult
wholly to understand him, but one thing
was clear to her, namely, that he was
refusing to marry her. She snatched her
hands out of his, and, starting wildly to
her feet with an inarticulate cry, ran a<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>
short distance and flung herself down on
her face among the bracken.</p>

<p>He looked after her, but he did not
follow her. He could do no more, and a
sense of exhaustion and distress was upon
him. He had been clumsy. He had hurt
the poor butterfly, after all.</p>

<p>He sat a long time on the tree-trunk,
the low sunshine on his worn, patient face,
on which the refinement of suffering and
of thought had set their indelible stamp.
And now the thin high features wore a
new look of present distress over the old
outlived troubles, a new look which
anyone who really loved him would have
been heart-stricken to have called into it.
But when love ceases to wound its object,
and bears its own cross, it has ceased to
be young.</p>

<p>As he sat motionless the sun sank.<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>
Far in the amber west the heavens had
opened in an agony of glory. The
knotted arms of the great oaks, upraised
like those of Moses and his brethren,
shone red as flame against the darkness
of the forest. The first hint of
chill after the great heat came into the
still air.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus rose and went slowly
towards the prostrate figure in its delicate
gleaming gown.</p>

<p>'Sibyl,' he said gently, but with
authority, 'you must get up. I see Doll
and your cousin coming up the glade to
meet us.'</p>

<p>Sibyl started violently and raised herself,
turning a white, hopeless face towards him.
Her entire self-abandonment, which would
have brought acute humiliation to another
woman, brought none to her. Her despair<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>
was too complete to admit of any other
feeling.</p>

<p>'Like a child's,' he thought, as he
looked at her sorrowing.</p>

<p>He helped her to smooth her gown, and
he set her hat straight, and took some
pieces of dried bracken out of her
crumpled shining hair. She let him do it,
neither helping nor hindering him. She
evidently did not care what impression
might be made on the minds of the two
young people leisurely approaching them.
She would have lain on the ground if it
had been a bog instead of dry turf until
the ice fit of despair had passed. His
thoughtfulness for her, and the ashen tint
of his face, were nothing to her, any more
than the moonshine is to the child who
has cried for the moon and has been
denied it.</p>

<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>

<p>At Mr. Loftus's bidding they went
slowly to meet the others.</p>

<p>'Doll,' said Mr. Loftus, lingering behind
as Peggy and Sibyl walked on together,
'give me your arm. I feel ill.'</p>

<p>'Won't she have me?' said Doll, biting
his lip.</p>

<p>'No, my poor boy, she won't.'</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstwords">The</span> laws of attraction remain a mystery.
Their results we see. Glimpses of their
workings can occasionally be caught in
their broken fragments. But the curve by
which the circle may be drawn is nowhere
to be found among those fragments.
The first cause we cannot see. With
sacrilegious hands we may rend the veil of
its temple in the sacred name of truth, but<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>
we shall find nothing in its holy of holies
save the bloodstains of generations of
sacrifices on its empty altar, and the place
where the ark has been.</p>

<p>Youth, beauty, wit&mdash;all these attract;
but they are only the momentary disciples
of a great master, and their power is from
him. In his name they perform a few
works, and cast out a few small devils.</p>

<p>But now and again a nature appears in
our midst in the presence of which youth
sinks its voice, and beauty pales and hangs
its head, and wit bends its knee in reverence.</p>

<p>What talisman had Mr. Loftus brought
into the world with him that disinterested
love and devotion should with one exception
have followed him all the days of his
life? But whether it had been given to
him at his birth, or he had found it alone<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>
upon the hillside, or Sorrow, who has
many treasures in her lap, but will never
give them to those who turn from her,
gave it to him when he kissed her hand&mdash;however
this may have been, he had it.</p>

<p>He had gone through his difficult life
little realizing how much he owed to the
impersonal love and respect which he
inspired in men and women, as a beautiful
woman seldom realizes how life has been
coloured for her by the colour of her hair
and eyes.</p>

<p>His poetic exalted nature, with its
tender affections, its deep passions, with
its refinement and its delicacy of feeling,
too sensitive to bear contact with this
rough world, and yet not content to dwell
apart from awkward fellow-creatures who
wounded when they touched it, had leaned
twice on the frail reed of personal love,<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>
and twice it had pierced his hand. After
the second time he withdrew his scarred
hand in silence, and journeyed on with it
in his bosom.</p>

<p>In the days of his youth he had been
swept into the vortex of a deep passion
which for the time engulfed his whole
being. His early marriage and his
romantic love, and his young wife's desertion
of him, consumed like a rolling
prairie-fire his early life. But he had
emerged with the mark of fire upon him,
and had taken up life again, and had made
a career for himself in the world of
politics.</p>

<p>And he had reached middle age, he
was a grave man with gray in his hair,
before love came to him the second time.
How he fared the second time no man
knew; but afterwards the love of woman,<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>
deep-rooted though it was, died down in
Mr. Loftus's heart. He went quietly on
his way, but the way wearied him. He
confided in no one, for he was burdened
with many confidences, and those on
whom others lean can seldom find a hand
to lean on in their greater weakness and
their deeper troubles.</p>

<p>But his physical health wavered. At
last his heart became affected, and after a
few warnings he was obliged to give up
public life. He ceased to be in authority,
but he remained an authority, and so lived
patiently on from year to year on the
verge of the grave, aware that at any
moment the next step might be across its
brink.</p>

<p>He had spoken the bare truth to Sibyl
when he told her that his life hung by a
thread. That this is so with all human<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>
life is a truism to which we all agree, but
which none of us believe. But in his case
the sword of Damocles was visible in the
air above him. He never took for granted,
if he went out for a walk, that he should
return; and on this particular May afternoon,
as he looked out from a friend's
house in Park Lane across the street to
the twinkle of green and the coloured
bands of hyacinths beyond the railings, he
locked his writing-table drawer from force
of long habit, and burned the letters he
had just read as carefully as if he were
going on a long journey, instead of a short
stroll across the park to Lady Pierpoint's
house in Kensington.</p>

<p>It was a heavy trouble that he had just
locked into the writing-table drawer&mdash;nothing
less than the sale of Wilderleigh,
which he and Doll, after much laying<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>
together of the gray head and the brown
one, had both come to the conclusion
could not be staved off any longer. For
the newly-imposed death-duties and the
increasing pressure of taxation on land,
in the teeth of increasing agricultural
depression, had been the death-blow of
Wilderleigh, as of so many other quiet
country homes and their owners. The
new aristocracy of the ironmaster and the
cheesemonger and the brewer had come
to the birth, and the old must give way
before the power of their money. Mr.
Loftus accepted the inevitable, and
Wilderleigh was to be sold.</p>

<p>He did not know for certain where
Lady Pierpoint was to be found, but he
would try the little house in Kensington.
He had seen her driving alone the
previous day, and he knew that she had<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>
quite recently returned with her daughter
and niece from Egypt, where they had
spent the winter months. Something in
the glimpse of her passing face yesterday
had awakened in him a vague suspicion
that she was in trouble. She looked older
and grayer, and why was she alone?</p>

<p>He took up his hat and, entering the
Park, struck across the grass in the
direction of the Albert Memorial, blinking
in all its gilt in the afternoon sun. The
blent green and gray of a May day in
London had translated the prose of the
Park into poetry. Here in the very heart
of the vast machine, Spring had ventured
to alight for a moment, undisturbed by
the distant roar of dusty struggling life all
round her. The new leaves on the
smoke-black branches of the trees were
for a moment green as those unfolding in<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>
country lanes. Smoke-black among the
silvery grass men lay strewn in the sunshine,
looking like cast-off rags flung
down, outworn by humanity, whose great
pulse was throbbing so near at hand.
Across the tender beauty of the young
year fell the shadow of crime and exhaustion,
and 'the every-day tragedy of the
cheapness of man.'</p>

<p>The shadow fell on Mr. Loftus's mind,
and he had well-nigh reached Lady Pierpoint's
door before his thoughts returned
to her and to her niece, Sibyl Carruthers.</p>

<p>'Pretty, delicate, impulsive creature, so
generous, so ignorant, so full of the
ephemeral enthusiasms of youth which
have no staying power. The real enthusiasms
of life are made of sterner stuff
than she, poor child! guesses. What will
become of her? What man in the future<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>
will take her ardent, fragile devotion, and
hold it without breaking it, and bask in the
green springtide of her love without desecrating
it, like those poor outcasts in the
Park?'</p>

<p>Lady Pierpoint was at home, and he was
presently ushered into the drawing-room,
where she was sitting in her walking
things. The room was without flowers,
without books, without any of the small
landmarks of occupation. It had evidently
been arranged only for the briefest stay,
and had as little welcome in it as a narrow
mind.</p>

<p>Lady Pierpoint, pouring tea out of a
metal teapot into an enormous teacup,
looked also as if she were on the point of
departure.</p>

<p>She greeted him cordially, and sent for
another cup. A further glance showed<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>
him that she looked worn and harassed.
Her cheerful motherly face was beginning
to droop like a mastiff's at the corners of
the mouth, in the manner in which anxiety
cruelly writes itself on plump middle-aged
faces.</p>

<p>'I am not really visible,' she said,
smiling, as she handed him the large cup
which matched her own. 'I cannot bring
forth butter in a lordly dish, as you perceive,
for everything is locked up. I am
here only for two days, cook-hunting.'</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus had intended to ask after
Sibyl, but he asked after Peggy instead.</p>

<p>'She is quite well,' said Lady Pierpoint.
'She is always well, I am thankful to say.
I have another Peggy coming out this
year&mdash;Molly&mdash;perhaps you remember her;
but how to bring her to London this
season I don't know. I have hardly seen<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>
anything of her all last winter, poor child!
as I was in Egypt with Sibyl. I have
only just returned to England.'</p>

<p>'And Miss Carruthers?' he said, examining
his metal teaspoon; 'will not she
be in London with you this season, with
your own daughters?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Lady Pierpoint, looking
narrowly at him; 'Sibyl is ill. I have
been very anxious about her all the winter.
I greatly fear that she will sink into a
decline. You know, her sister died of
consumption a year or two ago.'</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus looked blankly at Lady
Pierpoint.</p>

<p>'Sibyl!' he said&mdash;'ill? Oh, surely
there is some mistake? What do the
doctors say?'</p>

<p>'They all say the same thing,' said Lady
Pierpoint, her lips quivering. 'She had<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>
a cough last winter, and she is naturally
delicate, but there is no actual disease as
yet. But if she continues in this morbid
state of health&mdash;if she goes on as she is
at present&mdash;they say it will end in that.'</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus was silent.</p>

<p>Lady Pierpoint looked at his unconscious,
saddened, world-weary face, and
clasped her hands tightly together.</p>

<p>'Mr. Loftus,' she said, 'I am going
to put a great strain on our friendship,
and if I lose it, I must lose it. I have
been thinking of writing to you, but I
could not. I had thought of asking you
to come and see me while I was alone
here, but my courage failed me. But now
that you have come by what is called
chance, I dare not be a coward any longer.
Sibyl has told me of what passed last
summer between you and her.'</p>

<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>

<p>A faint colour came into Mr. Loftus's
pale face. He kept his eyes on the floor.</p>

<p>'I think,' he said gently, but with a
touch of reserve in his voice which did not
escape his companion, 'we must both
forget that as completely as she herself
has probably already forgotten it.'</p>

<p>'She has not forgotten it,' said Lady
Pierpoint, ignoring, though with a pang,
his evident wish to dismiss the subject.
'It is that which is causing her ill-health.
She can think of nothing else. Some of
us,' she said sadly, 'are so constituted that
we can bear trouble and disappointment&mdash;others
can't. This poor child, who has
cried for the moon, is not mentally and
physically strong enough to bear the disappointment
of being denied it. And
the doctors say that her life is dependent
on her happiness.'</p>

<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>

<p>Mr. Loftus rose, and paced up and
down the room. She dared not look at
him.</p>

<p>Presently he stopped, and, with his face
turned away, said with emotion:</p>

<p>'But the moon is a dreary place if it is
seen as it is, with its extinct volcanoes and
its ice-fields. Nothing lives there. The
fire in it is burnt out, and there is snow
over the ashes. It is only in the eyes of
a child that the moon is bright. We
elders know that it is dark and desolate.'</p>

<p>Lady Pierpoint was awed. She had
known Mr. Loftus for twenty years. He
had been kind to her in the early years of
her widowhood, and in the later ones had
helped on her boys by his influence in
high quarters. She had often told him of
her difficulties, but she had never till now
heard him speak of himself.</p>

<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>

<p>Her great admiration for him, which
was of a humbler kind than Sibyl's, led
her to say: 'It is not only in the child's
eyes that the moon is bright.'</p>

<p>She might have added with truth that
in her own middle-aged eyes it was bright,
too.</p>

<p>'I greatly honoured you when Sibyl
told me about it,' she continued, after a
long pause. 'It is because I have entire
trust in you that I have told you the truth
about this poor child, who is as dear to me
as my own, though I hope my own will
face life more bravely. Should you, after
reflection, feel able to do her this&mdash;this&mdash;great
kindness, I hope you will come and
stay with us at Abergower for Whitsuntide.
But&mdash;I shall not expect you, and
I shall not mention to anyone that I have
asked you.'</p>

<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>

<p>She rose and held out her hand. She
looked tired.</p>

<p>He held it a moment, and she endeavoured
to read the grave, inscrutable
glance that met hers, but she could not.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' he said, and went away.</p>

<p>'How dare she think of him?' said
Lady Pierpoint to herself.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'L'amour est une source naïve, partie de son lit
de cresson, de fleurs, de gravier, qui, rivière, qui,
fleuve, change de nature et d'aspect à chaque flot.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">De
Balzac.</span></p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstwords">In</span> England Spring is a poem. In the
Highlands of Scotland she has the intensity
of a passion. The crags and
steeps are possessed by her; they stand
transfigured like a stern man in the eyes
of his bride. And here in these solemn
depths and lonely heights, as nowhere
else, shy Spring abandons herself, secure
in the fastnesses where her every freak is
loved. She sets the broom ablaze among<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>
the gray rocks, yellow along the river's
edge, yet hardly yellower than the leaves
on the young oak just above. The larches
hear her voice, and hundred by hundred
peep over each other's heads upon the
hillside, all a-tremble with fairy green.
The shoots of the dwarf cherry, scattered
wide upon the uplands, are pink among
the grass. The primroses are everywhere,
though it is Whitsuntide&mdash;behind the
stones, among the broom, beside the little
tumbling streams, in every crevice, and on
every foothold. The mountain-ash holds
its white blossoms aloft in its careful
spreading fingers. Even the silver birch
forgets its sadness while spring reigns in
Scotland.</p>

<p>There are those to whom she speaks of
love, but there are many more to whom
she whispers, 'Be comforted.' When<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>
hope leaves us, it is well to go out into
the woods and listen to what Spring has
to say. Though life is gray, the primroses
are coming up all the same, and the young
shafts of the bluebell pierce the soft earth
in spite of our heartache. A hedge-sparrow
has built him a house in the
nearest tangle of white hawthorn. There
will be children's voices in it presently.
Be comforted. Hope is gone, but not
lost. You shall meet her again in the
faces of the children, God's other primroses.
She is not lost. She has only
taken her hand out of yours. Be comforted.</p>

<p>But Sibyl refused to be comforted. Her
love for Mr. Loftus, if small things may
be called by large names, was the first
violent emotion of a feeble and impulsive
mind in a feeble body, both swayed by<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>
veering influences, both shaken by the
changing currents of early womanhood, as
a silver birch is shaken with its leaves.</p>

<p>A woman with a deeper heart, and with
a slight perception of Mr. Loftus's character,
would have reverently folded her
devotion in her heart and have gone on
her way ennobled by it. But with Sibyl,
to admire anything was to wish to possess
it; to tire of anything was to cast it
away.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus was in her eyes without
an equal in the world. Therefore&mdash;the
reasoning from her point of view was conclusive&mdash;she
must marry him. She had
no knowledge, she had not even a glimpse,
of the gulf of feeling, far wider than the
gulf of years, which separated him from
her. She imagined no one appreciated
him, or entered into the dark places of his<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>
mind, as she did. She mistook his patient
comprehension of her trivial aspirations,
and his unfailing kindness to all young and
crude ideas, for the perfect sympathy of
two kindred souls, and was wont to speak
mysteriously to Peggy of how minds that
were really related drew each other out
and enriched each other.</p>

<p>It is always a dangerous experiment to
awaken a sleeping soul to the pageant of
life. Mr. Loftus had endeavoured to do
this for Sibyl, consciously, gently, with
great care, out of the mixed admiration
and pity with which she inspired him, in
the hope that, in later years, when her
feet would be swept from under her, she
might find something to cling to, amid the
wreck of happiness which his dispassionate
gaze foresaw that she would one day
achieve out of her life.</p>

<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>

<p>He had run the risk which all who would
fain help others must be content to run&mdash;the
risk that their work will be thrown
away. He saw that the little rock-pool
which reflected his own face was shallow,
but he had not gauged the measure of its
shallowness. His deep enthusiasms, tried
and tempered before she was born, weary
now with his own weariness, aroused hers
as the Atlantic wave, sweeping up the
rocks, just reaches and arouses the rock-pool,
and sends a flight of ripples over it,
which, if you look very close, break in
mimic waves against the further edge.
And before the thunder of the wave is
silent the pool is glass once more.</p>

<p>On natures like these the only influence
which can make any impression is a
personal one. It is overwhelming while
it lasts; but it is the teacher who is every<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>thing&mdash;the
teaching is nothing. And
when he is removed, they passively drift
under another personal influence, as under
another wave, and the work of the first,
the foundation patiently and lovingly built
in its pretty yellow sand, is swept away, or
remains in futile fragments, as a mark of
the folly of one who built on sand.</p>

<p>Certain strong, abiding principles Mr.
Loftus had sought to instil into Sibyl's
mind. She had perceived their truth and
beauty; but she cared nothing for them in
reality, and had fallen at the feet of the
man who had awakened those exquisite
feelings in her.</p>

<p>And now either she would not, or could
not, get up. She clung to her imaginary
passion with all the obstinacy which is
inherent in weak natures. The disappointment
had undermined her delicately-poised<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>
health. As she walked down towards the
Spey alone on this particular June afternoon,
she looked more fragile and ethereal
than ever. The faint colour had gone
from her cheek, and with it half her evanescent
prettiness had departed. Her slight,
willowy figure seemed to have no substance
beneath the many folds of white material
in which her despairing dressmaker had
draped her. With the suicidal recklessness
of youth, she made no attempt to turn her
mind to other thoughts, but pondered
instead upon her trouble, with the unreasoning
rebellion against it with which,
in early life, we all meet these friends in
disguise.</p>

<p>She picked her way down the steep
hillside, through the wakened broom and
sleeping heather, and along the edge of
the little oasis of oatfield, where so many<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>
thousands of round, river-worn stones had
been gleaned into heaps, and where so
many thousands still remained among the
springing corn. The long labour and the
patience and the partial failure which that
little field meant, reclaimed from the
heather, but not wholly reclaimed from the
stones, had often touched Lady Pierpoint,
who knew what labour was; but it did
not appeal to Sibyl.</p>

<p>She sat down with a sigh on the river-bank,
a forlorn white blot against the
crowded world of green, with Crack, her
little Scotch terrier, beside her, and looked
listlessly across the sliding water, which
ran deep and brown as Crack's brown
eyes, and loitered shallow and yellow as a
yellow sapphire among its clean gray stones
and gleaming rocks. A pair of oyster-catchers
sped upstream, low over the<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>
water, swift as eye could follow, with
glad cries, like disembodied spirits that
have found wings at last and feel the first
rapture of proving them.</p>

<p>'Happy birds!' said Sibyl to herself.
'They do not know what trouble means.'</p>

<p>Crack, who had heard this sentiment, or
something very like it, before, stretched himself
methodically, both front-legs together
first, and then the hind-legs one by one, and
walked slowly down to the edge of the
water and sniffed sadly, as one who knows
that search is vain among the stones for
a rat which is not there. Crack had a
fixed melancholy which nothing could
dispel. His early life had been passed
in the activity of a camp, and his spirit
seemed to have been permanently embittered
by the close contemplation of
military character. He had been round<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>
the world. He knew the principal smells
of our Eastern empire, but no reminiscences
of his many travels served to brighten the
gloomy tenor of his thoughts. He was
sad, disillusioned, still apt to hurry and
shorten himself through doors, and to
retreat under sofas to brood over imaginary
wrongs. All games distressed him. He
went indoors at once when the red ball
was produced which transformed Peter
from an elegant poodle into a bounding
demon. But in spite of his melancholy
he was liked. He went out but little, but
where he went he was welcomed. He
was a gentleman and a man of the world.
No dog ever quarrelled with him. He met
bristling overtures with a mournful tact
which turned growls into waggings of
tails. He himself was seldom seen to wag
his tail, except in his sleep.</p>

<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>

<p>He returned from the water's edge and
sat down on an outlying fold of Sibyl's
gown.</p>

<p>In the sunny stillness a wild-duck, with
cautious, advanced neck, and a little fleet
of water-babies, paddled past, bobbing on
the amber shallows. Crack raised his ears
and watched them. His feelings were so
entirely under control that he could scratch
himself while observing an object of
interest; and he did so now. But he did
not move from his seat on Sibyl's gown.
He was disillusioned about wild-ducks,
who did not play fair and stick to one
element, but would take to their wings
when hard pressed in the water, like a
woman who changes her ground when
cornered in argument.</p>

<p>Presently the afternoon sun shifted, and
all the larches on the steep hillside opposite<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>
and all the broom along the bank stooped
to gaze at a flickering fairyland of broom
and larches in the wide water. The deep
valley of the river was drowned in light.
Only the bank on which Sibyl was sitting
under the mountain-ash had fallen suddenly
into shadow.</p>

<p>'Like my life,' she thought, and rose
to go.</p>

<p>Who was this coming slowly towards
her along the little path by the water's
edge?</p>

<p>She stood still, trembling, her hands
pressed against her breast.</p>

<p>It was he. It was Mr. Loftus. He
was looking for her. He was coming to
her. Joy and terror seized her.</p>

<p>He saw her standing motionless in her
white gown under the white blossom-laden
tree. And as he drew near and took her<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>
nerveless hands in silence, and looked
into her face, he saw again in her deep
eyes the shy, imploring glance which had
met him once before&mdash;the mute entreaty
of love to be suffered to live.</p>

<p>'Sibyl,' he said, and in his voice there
was reverence as well as tenderness&mdash;reverence
for her untarnished youth, and
tenderness for the white flower of love
which it had put forth, 'will you be my
wife?'</p>

and I want to do something for him, or
make him something really pretty for his
handkerchiefs; but&mdash;I don't want to
marry him.'</p>

<p>'That is as well, my treasure, as he is
going to marry Sibyl.'</p>

<p>'I never thought he would marry
anybody. I can't believe it. It seems as
if it could not happen.'</p>

<p>'It will happen,' said Lady Pierpoint,
'if he lives.'</p>

<p>'Sibyl says,' continued Peggy, 'that he
enters into her feelings as no one else
does, and that she understands him, and
that hardly anyone else does except her,
because he is so superior.'</p>

<p>'Indeed!'</p>

<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>

<p>'And she says she can speak to him of
aspirations and things that she can't even
mention to Molly and me. She says it
isn't our fault&mdash;it is only because we are
different to her.'</p>

<p>'You are certainly very different,' said
Lady Pierpoint, compressing her lips.</p>

<p>'And to think that she might have
married Mr. Doll,' continued Peggy, as if
Sibyl's actions were indeed inscrutable.
'Mr. Doll will be twenty-eight next
August. He was twenty-seven when we
were at Wilderleigh last year. If I had
been Sibyl, I would have married him, and
then I'll tell you, mummy, what I would
have done. I would have asked Mr.
Loftus to let us live with him at Wilderleigh,
and I would have taken such care of
him&mdash;oh! such care&mdash;and I would have
spent whole bags of money on the farms<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>
and fences and things, and he would have
been happy, and Mr. Doll would have
been happy, too.'</p>

<p>'Peggy,' said Lady Pierpoint, 'shall I
tell you a secret? I think that is exactly
what Mr. Loftus hoped Sibyl would do.'</p>

<hr style="visibility: hidden; margin: 1.5em;">

<p>Mr. Loftus returned to London a day
or two later, and had an interview with
Doll the day before the announcement of
the engagement appeared in the <i>Morning
Post</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus was attached to his nephew&mdash;people
always looked upon Doll as his
nephew, though he was in reality his first
cousin&mdash;and to him and to him alone he
told the circumstances which had led to his
engagement.</p>

<p>What passed between the elder man
and the young one during that interview<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>
will never be known. But when at last
Mr. Loftus left him, Doll sat for a long
time looking over the geraniums into the
park. The somewhat dull, unimaginative
soul that dwelt behind his handsome expressionless
face was vaguely stirred.</p>

<p>'It's a mistake,' he said at last, half
aloud. 'But Uncle George is on the
square; he always is.'</p>

<p>And when he was ruthlessly twitted
next day by his brother officers on being
cut out by his uncle, he replied simply
enough:</p>

<p>'He is a better man than me, as all you
fellows know. She would not have looked
at one of you any more than she would at
me. I suppose she had a fancy for marrying
a man who could spell, which none of
us can.'</p>

<p>'Spelling or none,' said the youngest<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>
sub&mdash;'which is an indecent subject which
should never be mentioned between gentlemen&mdash;anyhow,
I mean to borrow a thousand
or a fiver off him. Mr. Loftus
always tipped me at school.'</p>

<p>One of Mr. Loftus's first actions was to
stop the preliminary proceedings regarding
the sale of Wilderleigh, which he had
been arranging a month ago, on the afternoon
when he had called on Lady Pierpoint.
It was like awakening from a
nightmare to realize that Wilderleigh
would not be sold, after all. He almost
wished that he might live long enough to
set the place in order for Doll.</p>

<p>The engagement was a nine days'
wonder, and those nine days were purposely
spent by Mr. Loftus in London.
He was aware that many cruel things
would be said at his expense, and that<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>
the bare fact that a man of his years and
in his state of health should marry a young
heiress, and so great an heiress as Sibyl
Carruthers, must call forth unfavourable
comments. People who did not know
him said it was perfectly shameful, and
that it was just the sort of thing which
those people who posed as being so extra
good always did. How shocked Mr.
Loftus had pretended to be when old
Lord Bugbear, after his infamous life,
married a girl of seventeen! And now
he, Mr. Loftus, was doing exactly the
same himself. Of course he had a very
fascinating manner&mdash;just the kind of
manner to impose on a young girl who,
like Miss Carruthers, knew nothing of
the world, and had been nowhere. And
everyone knew he was desperately poor.
Wilderleigh could hardly pay its way. A<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>
rumour had long been afloat that it would
shortly be for sale. If he had not been so
hard up for money it would have been
different; but it was a most disgraceful
thing, and Lady Pierpoint ought to be
ashamed of having exposed the poor
motherless girl left in her charge to his
designs upon her. They wondered how
much Lady Pierpoint, whose means were
narrow, had been bought over for. The
sums varied according to the sordidness
of the different speculators, who of course
named their own price.</p>

<p>Others who knew Mr. Loftus were
puzzled and were silent. To know him
at all was to believe him to be incapable
of an ignoble action; yet this marriage
had the appearance of being ignoble&mdash;not,
perhaps, for another man, but certainly
for him. His intimate friends were dis<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>tressed,
and greeted him with grave
cordiality and affection, and hoped for an
explanation. He gave none. And they
remembered that never in his public or
in his private life had he been known to
give an explanation of his conduct, and
came to the conclusion that they must
trust him.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus had recognised early in life
that explanations explain nothing. If
those who had had opportunities of
knowing him well misjudged him after
those opportunities, they were at liberty
to do so as far as he was concerned. The
weight of an enormous acquaintance oppressed
him, and, though he had never
been known to wound anyone by withdrawing
from an unequal friendship, which
he had not been the one to begin, and
which was an effort to him to continue,<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>
still, he took advantage of being misunderstood
to lay aside many such friendships.
It was not pride which prompted
this line of action on Mr. Loftus's part,
though many put it down to pride,
especially those who had held aloof from
him at a certain doubtful moment, and
in whose regard subsequent events had
entirely reinstated him, and who complained
that he expected to be considered
infallible. It was, in reality, the natural
inclination of a world-weary man of the
world to lay aside, as far as he could
courteously do so, the claims of the
artificial side of life, its vain forms, its
empty hospitalities.</p>

<p>He realized that for the purpose of
winnowing its friendships the various
events of life may be relied on to furnish
the fitting occasions. Those who do not<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>
wish to offend others by leaving them
need make no effort, for they will certainly
be presently deserted by those who have
never grasped the meaning of the character
which has been the object of their
transient admiration. 'If he is unequal
he will presently pass away.' Mr. Loftus
neither hurried the unequal, self-constituted
friend, nor sought to detain him. But
when he departed, shaking the dust from
off his feet, the door was noiselessly closed
behind him, and his knock, however loud,
was not heard when he returned again.</p>

<p>A small batch of uneasy admirers left
him on the occasion of his engagement.
They said openly that they were much
disappointed in him, and that he had
shaken their belief in human nature.</p>

<p>'Will Sibyl also pass away?' Mr.
Loftus wondered, as he sat on the terrace<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>
at Wilderleigh on his return from London.
'Yes, she, too, will presently pass away;
but I shall not give her time to do so.
She will be absorbed by her first love for
a few years, and I shall only remain a few
years at longest. By the time it wanes I
shall be gone, and my departure will pain
her but very slightly.'</p>

<p>His face softened as he thought of Sibyl.
His nature, which, in its far-away youth,
had been imaginative and romantic, had
remained sympathetic. He gauged, as
few others could have done had they been
the object of it, the measure of her romantic
attachment to himself. It was perhaps
safer in his hands than in those of a
younger man. For youth perpetrates
many murders and mutilations in the
name of love, as the schoolboy's love of
a butterfly finds expression in a pin and<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>
a cork. But it would have cut Sibyl to
the heart if she had even guessed that his
tranquil mind took for granted that her
adoration would not last until the stars fell
from heaven and the earth fell into the
sun. For 'Les esprits faibles ne sont
jamais sincères.' That is a hard saying,
but alas! and alas! that it is only the
weak who believe that it is not true. The
strong know better, but if they are merciful
they are silent.</p>

<p>'And so my second wife is also to be
an <i>esprit faible</i>,' said Mr. Loftus to himself,
looking at the past through half-closed
eyes. 'But in the meanwhile I have
learnt a lesson in natural history. I shall
not expect my butterfly to hew wood and
draw water. And this time I shall not
break my heart because pretty wings are
made to flutter with.'</p>

<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>

<p>And the remembrance slid through his
mind of Millais's picture of the dying
cavalier, and the butterfly perched upon
the drawn sword in the ardent sunshine.
And he thought of the drawn sword of
Damocles hanging over his own life, and
Sibyl's love preening itself for one brief
second upon it. And at the thought he
smiled.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstwords">Many</span> persons prophesied that the marriage
between Mr. Loftus and Sibyl would not
take place, but it did.</p>

<p>On a burning day late in July they were
married in London, for Sibyl's country
place, where Mr. Loftus had hoped the
wedding might have taken place, was
shut up.</p>

<p>Lady Pierpoint did all in her power to<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>
make the wedding a quiet one, for his
sake. Very few invitations were sent out,
and there was no reception afterwards.
But, nevertheless, though the season was
at its last gasp, when the day came the unfashionable
London church was crammed
with that 'smart' world, half of which had
condemned Mr. Loftus, while it showered
invitations upon him.</p>

<p>Many hundreds of eyes were fixed upon
his stately feeble figure as he moved
slowly forward to place himself beside the
young girl, whose emotion was plainly
visible, and whose bouquet shook in her
hand. The contrast between the two, as
they stood together, was of that glaring
description which appeals to the vulgar
and conventional mind, on which shades of
difference are lost.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus went through the ceremony<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>
with equanimity. His grave face betrayed
nothing except fatigue and the fact that
he was suffering from a severe headache.
Lady Pierpoint and Doll watched him
with anxiety, while Peggy, standing close
behind the bride, wept silently, she knew
not why.</p>

<p>'Oh, mummy,' she said afterwards
when it was all over, and Sibyl, anxious,
preoccupied, had left Lady Pierpoint and
Peggy and Molly, who had been mother
and sisters to her, without a tear, without
a regret, without a backward look, absorbed
in the one fact that Mr. Loftus was ill&mdash;'oh,
mummy, you say Sibyl loves him so
much. Is that why she did not mind
going away from all of us a bit? I know
he had a headache, but she never used to
mind when you had a headache, and when
she was ill, do you remember how she<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>
always sent for you, even when I told her
you were resting? And yet she used to
be a little fond of us. But since he came
she does not seem to care for us any more.
If one loves anybody, does one forget the
others?'</p>

<p>'Some women do,' said Lady Pierpoint,
taking Peggy's red, tear-stained face in
her hands and kissing it. She could not
bear to own, even to Peggy, how wounded
her warm maternal heart had been because
Sibyl, whose delicacy had given her so
many anxious hours, had shown no feeling
at parting with her. Mr. Loftus had
shown much more, when he had come to
speak to her alone for a few minutes in
her sitting-room, when the carriage was at
the door.</p>

<p>'Some women,' said Lady Pierpoint,
looking wistfully at her daughter, 'forget<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>
everyone else when they marry, and are
very proud of it. They think it shows
how devoted they are. A little cup is
soon full, Peggy, and a shallow heart, if it
takes in a new love, has no room left for
the old ones. The new love is like the
cuckoo in the nest&mdash;it elbows out everything
else.'</p>

<p>'I will not be like that,' said Peggy,
crushing her mother and her mother's
bonnet in an impulsive embrace. 'I will
have a deep, deep heart, mummy, and no
one shall ever go out that once comes in&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
mummy, you shall have the
best bedroom in my heart always!'</p>

<p>'I have a very foolish girl for a daughter,'
said Lady Pierpoint, somewhat comforted,
smiling through her tears, 'and one who
has no respect for my best bonnet.'</p>

<p class="fivestar center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>



<p>At Sibyl's wish she and Mr. Loftus
went straight to Wilderleigh. They
reached it after several hours' journey on
the evening of their wedding-day. And
gradually the nervous exhaustion and
acute headache from which he had been
suffering, and which had become almost
unbearable in the train, relaxed their hold
upon him. They were sitting in the cool,
scented twilight on the terrace. Through
the half-darkness came the low voice of
the river talking to itself. Noise and light
and other voices, and this dreadful day,
were gone at last.</p>

<p>He gave a sigh of relief and smiled
deprecatingly at her. They had hardly
spoken since they were married. She was
sitting near him, a slender figure in her
pale gown, that shimmered in the feeble
light. But there was light enough for her<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>
to see him smile, and she smiled back at
him with her whole heart in her lovely
eyes. No thought of self lurked in those
clear depths, and Mr. Loftus, looking into
them, and remembering how, on this her
wedding day, her whole mind had been
absorbed, to the entire oblivion of a bride's
divided feelings, in the one fact that he was
suffering, was touched, but not with elation.</p>

<p>The long listless hand lying palm upwards
on his knee made a slight movement,
and in instant response to it her hand was
placed in his. His closed over it. Perhaps
nothing could have endeared her
more to him than the mute response that
had waited on his mute appeal, and had
not forestalled it.</p>

<p>His hand clasping hers, he drew her
slightly, and, obeying its pressure, she
leaned towards him.</p>

<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>

<p>'My Sibyl!' he said, and she involuntarily
drew closer to him, for something in his
voice and manner, in spite of their exceeding
gentleness and tenderness, seemed to
remove him from her. 'Fate has been
hard upon you that I should have been ill
on your wedding-day.'</p>

<p>'No,' she said, timidly pushing off from
shore into the new world upon her little
raft. 'Fate was kind, because to-day has
been the first day when I could be with
you and take care of you.'</p>

<p>'You take too much care of me.'</p>

<p>'I care for nothing else,' she said, her
voice faltering, adoration in her eyes.</p>

<p>One white star peered low in the western
heaven through the violet dusk.</p>

<p>'Once long ago, before you were born,'
said Mr. Loftus, 'I loved someone, and
she said she loved me, and we were<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>
married. But after a time she brought
trouble upon me, Sibyl.'</p>

<p>The great current had caught the little
raft, and was hurrying it out to sea.</p>

<p>'I will never bring trouble upon you,'
said the young girl, her lips trembling as
she stooped to kiss his hand. 'When you
are tired you shall lean on my arm. When
your eyes are tired I will read to you. I
will take care of you, and keep all trouble
from you.'</p>

<p>'Till I die,' he said below his breath,
more to himself than to her.</p>

<p>'Till you die,' she answered.</p>

<p>And so, but this time very lightly, Mr.
Loftus leaned once again, or made as if
he leaned, on the fragile reed of human
love.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstwords">The</span> arrival of Sibyl at Wilderleigh was
the occasion of many anxious surmises at
the little Vicarage on the part of the young
Vicar and his young and adoring wife.</p>

<p>It had long been a great grief to them
that Mr. Loftus only came to church once
on Sunday. It was vaguely understood
that he had yielded himself to doubts on
religious subjects, which alone could account
for this 'laxity'&mdash;doubts which the <a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>young Vicar felt could not have shaken
himself or Mrs. Gresley, and which he was
convinced he could dispel. But he could
never obtain an opportunity to wage war
against these ghostly enemies, for though
he had preached during Lent a course of
sermons calculated to pulverize the infidel
tendencies of the age, which his wife had
pronounced to be all-conclusive and to
place the whole affair in a nutshell&mdash;it
certainly did that&mdash;unfortunately the person
for whose spiritual needs they were concocted
did not hear them.</p>

<p>Mr. Gresley had several times called
upon Mr. Loftus with a view to giving
the conversation a deeper turn, but when
he was actually in his presence, and Mr.
Loftus's steel-gray attentive eye was upon
him, the younger man found it difficult, not
to say impossible, to force conversation on <a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>subjects which Mr. Loftus had no intention
to discuss.</p>

<p>'If he would only meet me in fair
argument!' Mr. Gresley said on his return
from a futile attempt to approach Mr.
Loftus on the subject of public worship;
'but when I had thoroughly explained my
own views on the importance of regular
attendance at both services on Sunday, he
only said that those being my opinions, he
considered that I was fully justified in
having daily services as well. If he would
only meet me fairly and hear reason,' said
the young clergyman; 'but he won't.
The other day when I pressed him on the
subject of the devil&mdash;I know he is lax on
the devil&mdash;I said: "But, Mr. Loftus, do
you not believe in him?" If he had only
owned what I am sure was the case&mdash;namely,
that he did not believe in him&mdash;<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>I
could have confuted him in a moment.
I was quite ready. But he slipped out of
it by saying, "Believe in him! I would
not trust him for a moment." There is no
arguing with a man who scoffs or is silent.'</p>

<p>'My dear,' said Mrs. Gresley, 'infidels
are all like that, and their only refuge is to
be silent or profane. Don't you remember
when that professor from Oxford, whom
we met at Dr. Pearson's, said something
about history and the Bible&mdash;I forget
what, but it was perfectly unorthodox&mdash;and
Dr. Pearson was so interested, and
you spoke up at once, and he made no
reply whatever, and then asked me the
name of our Virginia creeper, and talked
about flowers. I often think of that, and
how he had to turn the subject.'</p>

<p>'But he was not convinced,' said Mr.
Gresley, frowning; 'that is the odd part of <a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>it. He brought out a book on the Bible
with things in it much worse than what he
said in my presence, and which I positively
refuted. And it went through six editions,
and the Bishop actually read it.'</p>

<p>'You see,' said Mrs. Gresley, with the
acumen which pervades the atmosphere of
so many country vicarages, 'a man like
the professor does not <i>want</i> to be convinced,
or his books would not be read,
any more than Mr. Loftus wants to be
convinced he ought to come to church
regularly, because then he would have no
excuse for staying away. But perhaps his
wife may be a Christian, James. They
say she is quite a young girl, and that her
aunt has brought her up well.'</p>

<p>And when Sibyl's sweet face and black
velvet hat, and a wonderful flowing gown
of white and lilac, appeared in the carved <a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>Wilderleigh pew beside Mr. Loftus's
familiar profile, the Gresleys hoped many
things; though Mrs. Gresley expressed
herself, after service, as much shocked at
the bride's style of dress, which she pronounced
to be too showy. Mrs. Gresley's
views on dress were exclusively formed at
the two garden-parties and the one private
ball to which she went in the course of the
year. The Gresleys thought it wrong to
go to public balls, and&mdash;which was quite
another matter&mdash;they thought it wrong for
other clergymen and their wives to go also.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that Mr. Loftus admired
his wife's style of dress, as he had
always admired Sibyl herself, from her
graceful, fringeless head to her slender,
low-heeled shoes. She pleased his
fastidious taste as perhaps no other woman
could have done. She was one of the few <a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>Englishwomen who can wear French
gowns as if they are part of them, and
not put on for the occasion.</p>

<p>After a becoming interval Mr. and Mrs.
Gresley called, and this time Mrs. Gresley
was somewhat mollified by what she called
the very 'suitable' costume of brown
holland in which Sibyl received them.
Mr. Loftus did not appear, and in the
course of conversation the young couple
were further pleasantly impressed with
the perfect orthodoxy and sound Church
teaching of the bride, whose natural gift
of platitude was enhanced by the subject
under discussion.</p>

<p>They also made the discovery that Mr.
Loftus was, in his wife's opinion, infallible.
And Mrs. Gresley looked with some
astonishment at a bride who actually
entertained towards a 'layman' the unique <a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>sentiments which she did for her apostolic
James.</p>

<p>'She is a nice young creature,' said
Mrs. Gresley, half an hour later, as, with
her hands full of orchids, she accompanied
her lord back to the Vicarage, 'and her
views, James, are beautiful&mdash;just what I
think myself. She agreed with everything
we said. She must have been very well
brought up. But I can't understand her
infatuation for Mr. Loftus. Really, from
the way she spoke of him, and how he
knew best, one might have supposed he
was priest as well as squire here. It
almost made one smile.'</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus and Crack had, in the
meanwhile, remained in the gardens, he
leaning back in a long deck-chair, looking
dreamily up into the perspective of moving
green above him, while Crack, who had <a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>only just arrived from Scotland, snapped
mournfully at the English flies, which
tasted very much the same as those of
Strathspey, so few new things are there
under the sun.</p>

<p>Sibyl had wished to bring Peter, the
poodle, also to Wilderleigh, but nothing
would induce Mr. Loftus to invite him.
He told Sibyl that he himself hoped to
replace Peter in her affections, and he had
certainly succeeded.</p>

<p>She returned to him now, and sat down
on a low stool at his feet. In these early
days she was much addicted to footstools
and the lowest of seats, provided they
were properly placed. They were in harmony
with her sentiments, and facilitated
an upward gaze.</p>

<p>'They were so pleasant. I wish you
had come in,' she said.</p>

<p><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>'I find the clergy as fatiguing as
Anderson's beetle found cleanliness,' said
Mr. Loftus, his eyes dwelling on her.
'But that is not their fault. It is because
I happen to be a beetle.'</p>

<p>'I was a little tired, too,' said Sibyl
hastily. 'They stayed rather long.'</p>

<p>'And did you like them?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I thought them very nice. And
I am glad they are High Church. I think
it is so much nicer, don't you?'</p>

<p>'Do you mean to tell me, now that we
are married and it is too late to go back,
that you are High Church?'</p>

<p>'Oh, not very high!' said Sibyl
anxiously, yet reassured by his look of
amusement. 'Which are you?'</p>

<p>'I am the same as Mr. Gresley,' said
Mr. Loftus slowly, 'with a difference.'</p>

<p>'I thought you were different,' said <a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>Sibyl, gratified at her own powers of
observation.</p>

<p>'I know,' continued Mr. Loftus, 'that
he thinks I have no principles at all,
because he believes they are not the same
as his; but in reality they are very much
the same as his, only they are carried
further afield, and he loses sight of them,
while he has a neat little ring-fence round
his own. I like Mr. Gresley very much.
He is an exemplary young man. But
some people become very narrow by
walking in the narrow path, and I fear
he is one of them. Remember this, my
Sibyl, that there is no barrier in your own
character against which someone, sooner
or later, will not stumble to his hurt.
No boundary in ourselves will serve to
shut God in, as this good young man
thinks, but every boundary will at last<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>
shut out some fellow-creature from us,
and be to one, whom perhaps we might
have helped, an occasion of stumbling.
And now let us show Crack the brook.
I am afraid he will think but little of it
after the Spey, but he will be too polite
to say so. As he only arrived yesterday,
it is premature to put it into words,
but I have an intuition that Crack and
I shall become friends. If I had any
influence over him, I would encourage
him to bathe in the brook, for he brought
into the house with him this morning an
odour that convinced me that we were on
the eve of some great chemical discovery.'</p>

<p>So they wandered down by the brook,
across the lengthening shadows. A cock
pheasant was clearing his throat in the
wood near the gardens. The low sun
had become entangled in the rookery. A<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>
pair of sandpipers were balancing their
slender selves on a tiny beach of sand.
A little black and white water-ousel darted
upstream with rapid, bee-like flight.
Crack followed, gravely investigating the
bank point by point, as if on the look-out
for some fallacy in it.</p>

<p>And Sibyl registered the conclusion in
her own mind that one must be 'wide,'
like Mr. Loftus, not narrow, like Mr.
Gresley. After this conversation she
always spoke of her religious convictions
as 'wide.'</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstwords">Summer</span> slid into autumn, and autumn
into winter. The first few months of
married life had been difficult to Mr.
Loftus, but he had brought his whole
attention and an infinite patience to bear
on them, and gradually his reward came to
him. Sibyl could learn because she loved.
She learned slowly, but still she did learn,
to read, not her husband's thoughts&mdash;those
were far from her&mdash;but his wishes.
She discovered, with a pang which cost<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>
her many secret tears&mdash;but still she did
discover&mdash;that he often wished to be alone,
and that she must not go into his study
unless she were asked to do so. She
learned gradually when to join him when
he paced in the rose-garden, and when it
vexed and wearied him to have her by
him. And she learned, too, after the first
horrible experience, which neither could
remember without anguish, when, with
blue lips, he had begged her not to
touch him; that when he had an attack
of the heart she must not betray her agony
of mind, if she was to be allowed to remain
in the room, and she must not ignorantly
try to apply the remedies, but must leave
it to Mr. Loftus's valet, whose imperturbable
calm and promptitude had often
ministered to his master before. Sibyl's
terror of death and violent emotion at<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>
its approach were peculiarly trying to
Mr. Loftus, who had long since ceased
to regard death with horror, and only
wished to be allowed to meet it quietly,
without a scene.</p>

<p>All intimacy was difficult to his solitary
nature. It was alien while it was courteously
welcomed. It was the natural
instinct of hers. She had to learn to
suppress her tenderness&mdash;or, at any rate,
its expression&mdash;a hard lesson for an over-demonstrative
nature, not long out of its
teens. But Sibyl learned even that for
his sake. And there her knowledge
stopped. It never reached beyond his
wishes to his mind. She was merged
entirely in her love of her husband, but
if he had been unworthy of the exalted
pedestal on which she had placed him,
she would not have discovered it.</p>

<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>

<p>'It might just as well have been Doll.'
Mr. Loftus thought occasionally, half
amused, when he had the barbarity to try
a platitude of the first water upon her&mdash;one
of Doll's best, such as the young man,
after diving into the recesses of his being,
could produce, and found she received it
with as much interest as the thoughts for
which he had dug deep. For hero-worship
was necessary to Sibyl, but not a hero&mdash;only
that she should consider him one.
The sham was to her the same as the
real. She saw no difference. Like many
another woman, she would have adored an
ass's ears, wondering at the blindness of
the rest of mankind. But if the truth
about those ears had been forced upon
her, rubbed into her, tattooed upon her,
her entire belief in human nature would
have fallen with the fall of one fellow-<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>creature.
The heights and depths of
human nature had never awed her, nor
its great forces moved her to reverence or
compassion. She was of the stuff out of
which the female cynic, as well as the
female devotee, is made.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus did not marvel at an adoration
which has been the birthright of his
fortunate sex since the world began, but his
perennial wonder at the enigma of feminine
human nature had a new element added to
it&mdash;that of amusement. She played with
his tools, as a robin perches on a spade,
thinking it is stuck in the earth for that
purpose, and for the turning up of worms.</p>

<p>The struggles, the despair, the hope and
the aspiration, through which his youth had
climbed, and out of which it had forged
its tools, were not a part of Sibyl's youth.
She liked the tools now that they were<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>
made, and desired them for her own small
uses. She was naturally drawn to those
of deeper convictions and larger faiths.
She liked the luxury of being moved by
them, stirred by them, lifted beyond herself
by a power outside of herself. She loved
to nibble the edge of their hard-earned
bread and feel that she, too, was of them,
and make believe that she had helped to
grind the flour; and to make believe with
Sibyl was the same thing as to believe.
Her insolvent nature clung to the rich
one, ostensibly because it was sympathetic,
but really because it was rich.</p>

<p>This unconscious audacity was a novel
source of entertainment to Mr. Loftus, a
bubbling wayside spring which he had
hardly hoped to meet with on the dry
highroad of married life. It is greatly to
be feared that his conscience, usually a<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>
tender one, was hardly as watchful as it
should have been on this subject. It
certainly had lapses when Sibyl conversed
with him seriously, especially when she
coupled his feelings with her own on the
greatest subjects, never doubting that they
were identical. But after a short time he
dared not speak to her of anything really
dear to him. She had a gift for making
sacred things common by touching them,
and age had not tarnished reverence in
Mr. Loftus's soul, though it had tarnished
many things which youth holds in reverence.
He talked to her, instead, on
subjects which he had not much at heart,
and that did quite as well.</p>

<p>And she, on her side, would bring to
him the inferior religious books, and superficial
unorthodox works which she believed
to be deep because they were unorthodox,<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>
which were the natural food of her little
soul, and he received them and her
remarks upon them, as he received a flower
when she gave him one, with courtesy and
gratitude.</p>

<p>So absorbed was she in her devotion to
her husband, and in the interchange of
beautiful sentiments, that her other duties,
increased by her position at Wilderleigh,
were not even perceived. Unobservant
persons are sometimes surprised at the
real devotion&mdash;and Sibyl's was real&mdash;of
which a shallow and cold-hearted
nature shows itself capable. But those
who look closer perceive at what heavy
expense to others that one link is
held, which is in reality only a new and
more subtle form of selfishness.</p>

<p>She dropped the other links without
even knowing that she had dropped them.<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>
She had no tender, watchful gratitude for
Lady Pierpoint, no interest in Peggy's new
gowns and lovers, or as to whether Molly
had enjoyed her first season. If this had
been pointed out to her, she would have
glibly ascribed the result to marriage,
which, according to some women, is the
death-bed of all sympathy and impersonal
love. It is like ascribing sin to temptation.</p>

<p>The Gresleys were much disappointed
in her, and they had reason to be so, for
Sibyl had changed over after her discovery
of Mr. Loftus's convictions, or, rather, her
interpretation of them, and, instead of being
rather High Church, had now decided to
be 'wide,' which state, it soon appeared,
was not compatible with being an efficient
helper to the earnest hard-working young
couple at her gate. Mr. Loftus, who now<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>
had command of money, was far more
considerate than his wife.</p>

<p>'She,' Mrs. Gresley complained, 'did
not seem to care to do anything with her
life, for she would neither sing in the choir
nor teach in the Sunday-school.'</p>

<p>She did consent to give prizes for
needlework in the schools, but when the
day came it was discovered that she had
forgotten all about it, and, as she had a
cold, Mr. Loftus drove into the nearest
town and brought a mind weighted with
political matter to bear upon the requisite
number of prizes suited to girls of from
seven to fourteen years, and hurried back
just in time to prevent disappointment by
distributing them himself.</p>

<p>'Have you written lately to Lady
Pierpoint?' he sometimes asked, and Sibyl
generally had to confess, 'Not lately,' and<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>
then she would write and then forget
again.</p>

<p>'I suppose Lady Pierpoint is less well
off now that you are married?' he asked
one day tentatively. 'No doubt your
guardians made her an allowance while
you lived with her.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Sibyl, who was sitting on
the hearthrug, trying to make Crack do
his trick of sitting up. It was his only
trick, and he could not do that unless he
happened to be sitting down when called
upon to perform it. If he were on all fours
at the moment, he could not remember
how it began. 'Aunt Marion often said
it was a very handsome allowance.'</p>

<p>'And have you continued it, or part of
it?' asked Mr. Loftus gravely.</p>

<p>Sibyl owned that she had never thought
of doing so.</p>

<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>

<p>'Everything I have is yours now,' she
said, looking up at him.</p>

<p>'And I am spending it,' he said, 'freely.
Thousands of yours are being put into the
estate, in repairs, and new farms and
buildings. I am like the man in Scripture
who pulled down his barns to build greater&mdash;at
least, who intended to do so if he had
had time.'</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus stopped. For the first time
for many years a faint wish crossed his
mind that his soul might not be required
of him till all those expensive improvements
were paid for, which would make
Doll's position as landlord easier than his
own had been.</p>

<p>'Even in these bad times,' he went on,
'Wilderleigh will come round. You have
taken a great weight off my mind, Sibyl.'</p>

<p>'That is what I wish,' she said, turning<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>
her face, as he put back a little ring of hair
behind her ear, so that her lips met his
hand.</p>

<p>'But Lady Pierpoint? I am afraid,
Sibyl, her husband left her very badly off.'</p>

<p>'I will write now,' said Sibyl, springing
to her feet.</p>

<p>Crack rose too, and jumped on Mr.
Loftus's knees, quietly pushing his hands
off them with his strong nose, and accommodating
his long, thin body by a few
jerks into the groove which a masculine
lap presents. Mr. Loftus did not want
him, and it tired him to keep his knees
together; but he knew there was a draught
on the floor, and he allowed him to remain.</p>

<p>'How much shall I say? A thousand
a year or fifteen hundred for her life?'
asked Sibyl, dipping her pen in the ink.
It was all one to her. She always gave<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>
freely of what cost her nothing&mdash;namely,
money.</p>

<p>'It must not be too much, or she won't
feel able to take it,' said Mr. Loftus,
considering. 'And if it is an annuity, it
does not help the children.' And he
wondered how far he dared go.</p>

<p>And when, a few days later, Lady
Pierpoint received a note from Sibyl,
very delicately and affectionately expressed,
and offering, in such a manner
as to make refusal almost impossible, a
sum of money more than sufficient to
provide for both her daughters, she
guessed immediately whose tact had
dictated the letter.</p>

<p>'Sibyl would never have thought of it,'
she said to herself, as she wrote a note of
acceptance. 'It never crossed her mind
when she left us, or even to offer to pay<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>
for Peggy's and Molly's bridesmaids'
gowns, although she chose such expensive
ones. And if it had occurred to her since,
she would not have put it like that.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Le monde est plein de gens qui ne sont pas plus
sages.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">La Fontaine.</span></p>


<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstwords">With</span> the winter came many invitations,
but they were nearly all refused, for Mr.
Loftus had long since dispensed himself
from attending county festivities, and
Sibyl, though she had recovered her
health, was always delicate. Lady Pierpoint
had had doubts as to whether she
ought to winter in England, but not only
was Sibyl herself determined so to do,
but when Lady Pierpoint saw her in
London before Christmas with a vivid <a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>colour and an elasticity of bearing which
made a marked contrast to the drooping,
listless demeanour of the previous winter,
her doubts were at once set at rest.</p>

<p>Presently, however, an invitation came
for a masked ball in the immediate neighbourhood,
which Mr. Loftus decided could
not be refused.</p>

<p>'But why should we go?' said Sibyl,
'if we don't care about it. And I hate
balls, and I hate society. I was saying
so to the Gresleys only yesterday. I love
my own fireside and a book.'</p>

<p>Sibyl had no idea how much these
occasional mild flourishes, which found
great favour at the Vicarage, annoyed
Mr. Loftus. She put them forth, poor
thing! with a view to showing him how
much she had in common with him.</p>

<p>'It is a mistake to say you hate society,'<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>
said Mr. Loftus, 'because you are not in a
position to hate what you have never seen.
Personally, I can see nothing peculiarly
obnoxious in my fellow-creatures when
they have their diamonds and white ties
on. I do not even discover that they are
more worldly in ball-gowns than on other
occasions.'</p>

<p>'But it is all so empty and vain,' said
Sibyl; 'and though I dare say I have not
seen much, still, the small-talk is so wearying,
and I suppose that is the same
everywhere. I should not mind society if
there was any real conversation, anything
<i>deep</i>.'</p>

<p>Sibyl loved the word 'deep.' She used
it on the occasions when others use the
word 'trite,' she meaning the same as
they did, but looking at the trite from
a different angle. From her point of <a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>vantage, eccentricity was originality, and
a wholesale contradiction of established
facts a new view.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus was so close on the verge
of annoyance that he was obliged to be
amused instead.</p>

<p>'I have heard many people say they
hated society,' he said, smiling, and Sibyl
smiled back at him, delighted at having
won his approbation by the nobility and
originality of her sentiments.</p>

<p>'I have generally found that they are
persons to whom, probably for some
excellent reason, society has shown the
cold shoulder, or those, like the Gresleys,
who have never seen anything of it, and
who call garden-parties, and flower-shows,
and bazaars, and all those dismal local
functions, society.'</p>

<p>'She is not going to this masked ball,'<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>
said Sibyl. 'I asked her, and she said,
"Of course not. Her husband being a
clergyman made it quite impossible." I
wonder why she always says things are
quite impossible for the clergy that most
of the other clergy do. She said the
same about the Hunt Ball.'</p>

<p>'That was because of the pink coats of
the men and the new gowns of the
women, and also partly because they
were not asked. It happened to be a
good ball, consequently it was dangerous.
Dowdiness has from a very early date
of this world's history been regarded as
a sacrifice acceptable to the Deity, so
naturally pretty gowns and electric light
are considered to be the perquisites of the
Evil One.'</p>

<p>'But are we really going to this ball?'</p>

<p>'We are. It would be unneighbourly<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>
not to do so. I met Lady Pontesbury
yesterday in D&mdash;&mdash;, and she begged us to
support her, and to bring even numbers.
People cannot give balls in the country,
Sibyl, if none of the neighbours will take
the trouble to fill their houses. I have
seen very cruel things of that kind done.
Ours is the largest house in the neighbourhood,
and, as it now has a mistress, we
must fill it.'</p>

<p>The idea of society having any claim on
her was a new light to Sibyl. She had
always considered herself superior to its
blandishments. But now that she discovered
that Mr. Loftus actually regarded
certain social acts as a duty, and this
masked ball as one in particular, she
immediately changed her opinion, and
forthwith looked upon it as a duty also.
It was a duty which, as its fulfilment drew<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>
near, became less and less unpleasant to
anticipate.</p>

<p>She had until now lent a sympathetic
ear to the Gresleys when they talked of
society as a snare, and had echoed Mr.
Gresley's remarks on the same.</p>

<p>'Balls are not wrong in themselves,'
Mr. Gresley would say in his chest voice,
keeping his hand in before Sibyl and his
admiring wife. 'It is only the abuse of
them that is blameworthy. Use the world
as not abusing it. A carpet dance among
young people I should be the last to blame.
We cannot keep the bow always at full
stretch. But when it comes to ball after
ball, party after party, and pleasure is
made a business, instead of a recreation,
by which I mean that which restores
elasticity to the exhausted faculties, recreates
us in fact, and renews our energy<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>
for our work, then indeed&mdash;&mdash;' And Mr.
Gresley would express himself at that
length which is apparently the one great
compensation of the teacher who has no
pupils.</p>

<p>Sibyl enjoyed his conversation very
much. She thought Mr. Gresley a very
sensible person, and his opinions were in
harmony with her own.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gresley had also declared, after a
brief visit to Kensington in July during
the 'sales,' that she had neither the means
nor the inclination to throw herself into
the social whirlpool which she and Mr.
Gresley had dispassionately viewed from
two green chairs in the Row, and which
Mr. Gresley had estimated 'at its true
worth.' If she had possessed both the
means and the inclination, she would
perhaps have discovered that she was no<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>
nearer to that vortex than the many
thousands who annually make a pilgrimage
to London only to be tossed on the outermost
ripple of the whirlpool, and who
revolve for ever on the rim of society like
Saturn's rings, without approaching the
central luminary. But that it is difficult to
be loved of Society and ensnared by her
the Gresleys and Sibyl did not know, any
more than that certain crimes require
great qualities in order to commit them.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus might have been able to
relieve their ignorance, but, as Sibyl told
the Gresleys, he did not care much for
conversation.</p>

<p>A habit of silence was certainly growing
upon him since his marriage.</p>

</div></div>


<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstwords">The</span> night of the masked ball had arrived.
A large party had assembled at Wilderleigh,
including Lady Pierpoint and her
daughters, and Doll. It was Doll's first
visit to Wilderleigh since Mr. Loftus's
marriage, and as he looked down the
dinner-table at Sibyl he wondered at his
own folly in coming. He thought he had
'got over it,' but to-night he found that
he had made a sufficiently grave mistake
in supposing so. Unimaginative persons <a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>never know when they have got over
anything, because they have no fore-knowledge
in absence of the stab which
a certain presence can inflict. So Doll
walked stolidly in&mdash;where Mr. Loftus in a
remote but not forgotten passage of his
own life had feared to tread&mdash;and then
writhed and bit his lip at the hurt he had
inflicted upon himself.</p>

<p>In the days when he had hoped to marry
Sibyl, he had often pictured her to himself&mdash;his
imagination could reach as far as
tangible objects, such as furniture and food
and raiment&mdash;sitting at the head of his
table, talking to his guests, wearing the
Wilderleigh diamonds, and looking as she
looked now; for to-night Sibyl was
beautiful. And it had all come about,
except one thing&mdash;that she was married
to Mr. Loftus instead of to him. He<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>
turned to look fixedly at Mr. Loftus
talking to Lady Pierpoint, and saw as in
some new and arid light his thin stooping
figure in the carved high-backed chair, the
refined profile with the high thin nose and
scant brushed-back gray hair, and the
bloodless Vandyke hand holding his wine-glass.
Mr. Loftus had a very beautiful
hand. Doll had not seen Mr. Loftus and
Sibyl together except at the altar-rails.
And as he looked rage took him. It was
a monstrous marriage. The blood rushed
to his face, and beat in his temples. And
a sudden bitter hatred surged up within
him against Mr. Loftus as man against
man. He looked at him again in his gray
hair and his feebleness, and loathed him.</p>

<p>And Mr. Loftus's indifferent kindly
glance met his, and he smiled quietly at
him. And the cold fit came after the hot<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>
one, and poor Doll cursed himself, and told
himself for the first time of many times&mdash;of
how many times!&mdash;that the greatest evil
that could befall him in life would be to
become estranged from 'Uncle George.'</p>

<p>'What are you thinking of?' said
Peggy's voice at his elbow. Peggy was
often at Doll's elbow at other times
besides dinner, a fact which did not escape
Lady Pierpoint's maternal eye, but for
which she did not reprimand Peggy, any
more than for her slightly upturned nose
and little upper lip, which turned up in
sympathy too. But Peggy vaguely felt
that on this occasion her dear 'mummy'
was rather in the way, especially when the
whole party assembled in the hall in their
masks and dominoes, and Peggy could not
sufficiently admire Doll's flame-coloured
garment with a black devil outlined on the <a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>back and a hood with pointed ears. She
had no eyes for Captain Charrington, the
tallest man in the Guards, magnificent in
crimson silk from head to foot, with
crimson mask as well, or for another of
Doll's companions in arms in a chessboard
domino of black and white with an
appalling white mask.</p>

<p>'Look, Peggy,' said Lady Pierpoint,
'at Mrs. Devereux. I think I have never
seen any domino as pretty as her white
one with little silver bees all over it.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Devereux protested, in a muffled
manner, through the lace edge of her mask
that Miss Pierpoint's and Mrs. Loftus's
duplicate primrose ones edged with gold
quite put her bees into the shade.</p>

<p>'Into a hive you mean,' said her
husband, a dull young man in dove colour.<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>
'But how are we to know Mrs. Loftus and
Miss Pierpoint apart?'</p>

<p>'You won't know us,' said Sibyl; 'that
is just the point.'</p>

<p class="fivestar center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>'There is one thing I ought to have
asked you before,' said Sibyl solemnly in
her married-woman voice, as the brougham
in which she and Mr. Loftus had driven
together drew up in the <i>queue</i>. 'Would
you like me to dance or not?'</p>

<p>'Are you fond of dancing?'</p>

<p>'Very&mdash;at least, I mean I don't mind.'</p>

<p>'Then, dance by all means.'</p>

<p>'You are quite sure it is what you wish.
I thought perhaps as a married woman&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Married goose,' said Mr. Loftus, laughing,
perfectly aware that she would have
liked him to be jealous.</p>

<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>

<p class="fivestar center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>'I'm going to dance,' whispered Sibyl
to Peggy, as they followed Mr. Loftus and
Lady Pierpoint, the only unmasked ones
of the party, towards the ballroom. 'He
says he wishes me to. He is always so
unselfish.'</p>

<p>But Peggy's open eyes and mouth and
whole attention were turned to the ballroom
which they were entering.</p>

<p>Lord and Lady Pontesbury were standing
near the entrance solemnly shaking
hands with the masked hooded figures who
came silently towards them. No introductions
were possible. Lord Pontesbury
almost embraced Mr. Loftus, so relieved
was he to see a human face. Lady
Pontesbury beamed on Lady Pierpoint.</p>

<p>'Your girls here?' she whispered. No
one seemed able to speak above a whisper.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Lady Pierpoint below her<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>
breath, looking helplessly round at the
twenty muffled figures in her wake. And
Captain Charrington came forward at once,
and said he was the eldest, and produced
Doll as his youngest sister, while Peggy
and Molly wondered how anyone could be
so funny and live.</p>

<p>The long ballroom, with its cedar-panelled
walls outlined in gilding, was
brilliantly lighted. The floor of pale
polished oak shone like the pale walls.
Banks of orchids rose in the bay-windows.
In the brilliant light a vast crowd of
spectral figures stalked about in silence,
clad in every variety and incongruous
mixture of colour.</p>

<p>'Like devils out on a holiday,' said a
voice from the depths of a fool's cap and
bells.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus was at once surrounded by<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>
masked figures who shook hands with him
warmly. A Bishop was the centre of
another group, ruefully responding to he
knew not whom, half the young men in
the room telling him that they had met
him last at the Palace when they were
ordained.</p>

<p>One mischievous couple were making the
circuit of the room, conversing with the
chaperons one after the other, who smiled
helplessly at them and answered but little,
for middle-aged ladies with daughters
out have other things to think of besides
repartee. Captain Charrington sustained
his character of a wit by walking about
growling at intervals in a mysterious and
interesting manner.</p>

<p>The band took its courage in both hands,
and broke the silence. A tremor passed
through the crowd. There was a momen<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>tary
pause, a momentary uncertainty as to
the sex of the hooded figures, and then
forty, fifty, seventy couples of demons were
solemnly polkaing.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus smiled. Sibyl, standing by
him, laughed till he gently urged her to
take it more quietly. Lord and Lady
Pontesbury turned for a moment from the
fresh arrivals, and their mournful faces
relaxed. The Bishop, who seldom saw
anything more enlivening than a confirmation
or a diocesan gathering, shed tears.
The trombone collapsed, the wind instruments
wavered, and left the violins for a
moment to make desperate music by
themselves. Then the band pulled itself
together, and the music and the flying
feet rushed headlong on.</p>
<p class="fivestar center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>



<p>Doll, who had hardly spoken to Sibyl
that day, came up to claim his dance.</p>

<p>'I can't dance any more,' she said
plaintively. 'My domino weighs me
down. Let us sit out.'</p>

<p>'Shall we go into the gallery,' said Doll,
'and watch the unmasking from there?
It is a quarter to twelve now, and every
one unmasks at twelve.'</p>

<p>He did not know whether to be glad or
sorry that she would not dance with him.
'Better not,' he said to himself. But he
had thought of the possibility of that
dance many times before he reached the
ballroom, and had decided that it was his
duty to ask her.</p>

<p>They left the ballroom, and, passing
numerous ghostly figures sitting in nooks
and on the wide staircase, they made their
way to the arched gallery which overhung <a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>the ballroom. Every white arch had
been lit by a pendent pink-shaded lamp,
and the arches and Sibyl's primrose
domino all took the same rosy hue. In
nearly every arch a couple were already
sitting, watching the crowd below. Doll
secured one of the few vacant places, and
Sibyl drew her chair forward and leaned
her slender bare arms on the white stone
balustrade. The couple in the adjoining
archway were chattering volubly, but Doll
and Sibyl did not talk. She did not notice
the omission, for her eyes were following
the quaint pageant with the delight of a
child. Doll racked his brains for something
to say, and found nothing.</p>

<p>Why had she married Uncle George?
Why had she married Uncle George? So,
as he could not ask her that, and tell her
that he cared for her a hundred times <a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>more than her husband did, he said
nothing.</p>

<p>The <i>pas de quatre</i> was in full swing.
The men, annoyed by their long dominoes,
and having one hand disengaged, raised
their voluminous skirts and danced with
long black legs, regardless of propriety.
Captain Charrington's endless crimson
domino had come open in front and displayed
his high action to great advantage.
A very elegant pink domino, which had
been introduced by the eldest son of the
house as an heiress to all the men whom
he did not recognise, and which had
danced only with masculine dominoes, was
now seen to emulate its partner, and to
have black trousers rolled up above its
white-stockinged ankles, and rather large
white satin shoes.</p>

<p>'Look!' said the girl in the next arch<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>way;
'that pink domino must be Mr.
Lumley. He often acts as a woman.'</p>

<p>'Hang him for an impostor! I've
danced with him as such,' said the man,
with ill-concealed vexation. 'He knew
me, and called me by name. I took him
for&mdash;&mdash;' He did not finish his sentence.
'By Jove! that black domino with a
death's-head and cross-bones is a good
idea,' he went on. 'Is it half-mourning,
do you suppose?'</p>

<p>'How foolish you are! That is Lord
Lutwyche. I have just been dancing with
him.'</p>

<p>'Lord Lutwyche is not here. He
sprained his ankle at hockey yesterday.'</p>

<p>The female domino appeared to be a
prey to uneasy reflections.</p>

<p>'The primrose domino is the prettiest
in the room,' she said presently. 'And<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>
how well she dances! I wonder who
she is.'</p>

<p>'I happen to know that is Mrs. Loftus.'</p>

<p>Sibyl, with her back to the arch, could
hear every word on the other side of it.
Doll was not near enough. This was
indeed delightful! How lucky that she
and Peggy had come dressed alike!</p>

<p>'Which is Mr. Loftus?' said the
woman's voice eagerly. 'I have heard
so much about him.'</p>

<p>'That tall, thin, fine-looking old chap
with his hands behind his back, standing
by the Bishop. The Union Jack domino
is speaking to him.'</p>

<p>'So that is he. I have always wished
to see him. He looks tired to <a name="tn_png_139"></a><!--TN: Single quote added after "death."-->death.'</p>

<p>'He always looks like that. Quite a
character, though, isn't he?'</p>

<p>'He has an interesting face. But it<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>
was a disgraceful thing, his marrying a
pretty young girl, and an heiress, at his
age.'</p>

<p>Sibyl made a sudden movement, and
the other couple glanced round. They
saw her, but her primrose domino had
taken the pink of her surroundings, and
they suspected nothing.</p>

<p>'I'm not so sure. His nephew stands
up for him, though his uncle cut him out,
and his nephew ought to know. I fancy
there was more in that marriage than
outsiders suspect. I've heard it said more
than once that she fell head-over-ears in
love with him, and he married her out of
pity.'</p>

<p>The last words fell distinctly on Sibyl's
ears, and at that second the music ceased
with a crash, and a gong boomed out,
engulfing all other sounds. It was twelve<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>
o'clock. A bell somewhere just above
them was counting out twelve slow strokes,
just too late&mdash;just ten seconds too late.</p>

<p>She leaned back sick and shivering.</p>

<p>She did not realize that the crash and
the tolling bell were part of the evening's
programme. They seemed to her the
natural result of the words she had just
heard. If she had been crossed in love at
Lisbon before the earthquake, she would
have regarded that upheaval as the immediate
consequence of her lacerated
feelings.</p>

<p>'Look, look!' said the woman; 'they
are unmasking.'</p>

<p>A confused sound of laughter and surprise
and recognition, and a widespread
hum of conversation, came up to them.</p>

<p>Everyone was streaming out of the
gallery, and in the ballroom there was<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>
a vast turmoil, as of hiving bees, and a
throng at every door.</p>

<p>'Shall I take you to the cloak-room to
leave your mask and domino?' said Doll,
turning to her at last, from watching
without seeing it what was passing below.
He took off his velvet mask as he spoke.
The sullen wretchedness of his face fitted
ill with the pointed rakish ears which still
surmounted it.</p>

<p>She did not answer. He saw that the
outstretched hand still on the balustrade
was tightly clenched.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Loftus,' he said. 'Sibyl! what is
it? Are you ill?'</p>

<p>She tore off her mask, and, as if she
were suffocating, plucked with trembling
hands at the gold ribbon that fastened her
hood and domino.</p>

<p>He was alarmed, and clumsily helped<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>
her to loosen them. Her small face,
released from the mask, looked shrunk
and pinched like a squirrel's in its thrown-back
hood. The pink glow upon it from
the lamp was in horrible contrast with
its agonized expression.</p>

<p>'What is it? what is it?' said Doll, in
distress nearly as great as her own, taking
her little clenched hand, and holding it, still
clenched, in his large grasp. 'Are you ill?'</p>

<p>She shook her head impatiently.</p>

<p>'Would you like&mdash;shall I&mdash;fetch Mr.
Loftus?'</p>

<p>She winced as if she had been struck.</p>

<p>'No,' she gasped; 'I will not see him&mdash;I
will not see him!'</p>

<p>A change came over Doll's face. Involuntarily,
his hand tightened its clasp on
hers.</p>
<p class="fivestar center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>


<p>'These entertainments,' said the Bishop
to Mr. Loftus, as they paused for a
moment in the gallery, and looked down
into the ballroom, which was now rapidly
refilling with gaily-dressed women and pink
and black coats, 'are, I believe, typical of
English country life. They are&mdash;ahem!&mdash;the
gallery seems conducive to conversation;
it is, in fact, a&mdash;er&mdash;whispering-gallery.'
Here he turned, smiling, to Mr.
Loftus. 'Perhaps Mr. Doll has hardly
reached the stage at which he will call
upon me to officiate&mdash;just so; we will go
down by the other staircase&mdash;but I trust,
though I might be in the way at present,
that my services may be required a little
later on.'</p>

<p>'I should like to see Doll married,' said
Mr. Loftus, who had been not a little
surprised at the eager manner in which<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>
the young man was bending towards the
figure with her back towards them, whose
fallen-back hood intercepted her features.
He recognised the domino.</p>

<p>'I had no idea Peggy had made such
an impression,' he said to himself.</p>

<p>As he re-entered the ballroom, he met
Lady Pierpoint, also returning to it with
her two plump little girls in tow, whom
she had been tidying in the cloak-room.
Captain Charrington and some of the
other men from Wilderleigh were waiting
near the doorway, claiming first dances as
their party came in. The orchestra, who
had been refreshing themselves, were remounting
to their places.</p>

<p>'Then, where is Sibyl?' said Mr. Loftus,
looking at Peggy.</p>

<p>'She went to the gallery a long time
ago,' replied Peggy promptly, 'with Mr.<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>
Doll, to see the people unmask at twelve
o'clock.'</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus smiled. 'It was a horrible
sight as seen from below,' he said; 'half
the men's faces were black, and the hair
of every one of them stood up at the
back.'</p>

<p>The band struck up a swaying, languorous
valse such as tears the hearts out of
young persons in their teens.</p>

<p class="fivestar center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>'I must go home,' Sibyl kept repeating
feverishly. 'Doll, you must get the
carriage. I must go home.'</p>

<p>Doll was engaged to Peggy for this
valse, but he had forgotten it. Sibyl was
engaged to Captain Charrington, but she
had forgotten it.</p>

<p>He was terrified, as only reticent persons
can be, lest her loss of self-control should<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>
be observed. He helped her to her
feet, and took her to the cloak-room,
she clinging convulsively to him. Her
entire disregard of appearances filled him
with apprehension. The cloak-room was
empty, even of attendants, for it had been
thronged till within the last ten minutes,
and now the wave had surged back to
the ballroom, and the maids, their duties
finished, had slipped away to see the
spectacle.</p>

<p>Sibyl cast herself down on a chair,
shivering. Her little Grecian crown of
diamonds fell crooked.</p>

<p>'Let me fetch Lady Pierpoint,' said
Doll urgently.</p>

<p>'No, no,' she said imploringly; 'I want
to go home. Oh, Doll, get the carriage,
and take me home. Is it so much to
ask?'</p>

<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>

<p>He looked at her in doubt. She was
not fit to return to the ballroom. Evidently
she would make no attempt to
conceal her despair, whatever its cause
might be, from the first chance comer.</p>

<p>'I will take you,' he said; and he rushed
out to the stables, found the Wilderleigh
coachman, and himself helped to put the
horses into the brougham.</p>

<p>'It was ordered for one o'clock especially
for Mr. Loftus,' said the coachman, hesitating,
'and the landau, and the fly, and the
homnibus for half-past three.'</p>

<p>'You will be back in time for Mr.
Loftus,' said Doll. 'Mrs. Loftus is ill,
and must go home immediately.'</p>

<p>He had the brougham at the door in
ten minutes, and returned to the cloak-room
to find a maid standing by Sibyl
with a glass of water. Sibyl was still<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>
shivering, holding on to the chair with
both hands, her eyes half closed, her face
ghastly.</p>

<p>'I am afraid the lady is ill,' said the
servant.</p>

<p>It was very evident that she was ill.</p>

<p>'The carriage is here,' said Doll. 'Can
you manage to walk to it?'</p>

<p>She rose unsteadily, and the maid
wrapped her in her white cloak. It
annoyed Doll that the maid evidently
looked upon them as an interesting young
married couple.</p>

<p>He gave Sibyl his arm, and she staggered
against him. He hesitated, and
then compressed his lips, put his arm
round her, and, half carrying, half leading
her, helped her to the carriage.</p>

<p>It was a white night with snow upon
the ground. The band was playing one<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>
of Chevalier's songs. Out into the solemn
night came the urgent appeal of ''Enery
'Awkins' to his Eliza not to die an old
maid, accompanied by the dull, threshing
sound of many feet.</p>

<p>As the carriage began to move, Sibyl
seemed to revive, and a moan broke from
her.</p>

<p>'Oh, Doll,' she said suddenly, turning
towards him and catching his hand and
wringing it. 'It isn't true, is it? It is
only a horrible lie.'</p>

<p>'What isn't true?' he said fiercely, almost
hating her for the pain she was causing
him, not his hand.</p>

<p>'It isn't true what that man said in the
next arch, that&mdash;that Mr. Loftus married
me out of pity?' And she swayed herself
to and fro.</p>

<p>She had asked the only person to whom<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>
Mr. Loftus had confided his real reasons
for his marriage.</p>

<p>It had been on the tip of Doll's tongue
all the evening to say: 'Why did you
marry him? <i>I</i> would have married you
for love.' But he mastered himself.</p>

<p>'It isn't true, is it?' gasped Sibyl.</p>

<p>Doll set his teeth.</p>

<p>'No,' he said. 'It's a lie. He married
you for love. He&mdash;<i>told me so</i>!'</p>

<p class="centerquot center">'Pour connaître il faut savoir ignorer.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Amiel.</span></p>


<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstwords">'Doll,'</span> said Mr. Loftus, the morning
after the ball, when all the guests had
departed, except the Pierpoints, 'I do not
expect absolute perfection in my fellow-creatures,
but it appeared to me that you
fell rather below your usual near approach
to it last night. What do <i>you</i> think?'</p>

<p>Doll answered nothing.</p>

<p>'You see,' went on Mr. Loftus, 'after
twelve o'clock, when everyone unmasked,
was the time when I should naturally have
introduced Sibyl to many of our friends<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>
and neighbours, as this was her first
public appearance since her marriage, and
I could not do so on our arrival. The
fact that she had left the house without
me, and&mdash;without my knowledge&mdash;was
unfortunate.'</p>

<p>It had been more than unfortunate in
reality. Mr. Loftus, whose marriage had
made a great sensation in his own county,
had been begged on all sides, as soon as
the masks were off, to introduce his wife,
and, though he had not shown any surprise
at her non-appearance and Doll's, he
had at last been obliged to retire to the
men's cloak-room and wait there till his
carriage came, so as to obscure the fact
that she had departed without him. He
had been annoyed at what he took to be
Doll's heedlessness of appearances.</p>

<p>'She felt ill, and wished to go home,'<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>
said Doll, reddening, and not perceiving
that he was offering an explanation which
did not cover the ground. He would have
been perfectly satisfied with it himself.</p>

<p>'I greatly fear that she <i>is</i> ill,' said
Mr. Loftus; 'but she was quite well
when she went to the ball last night. She
is very delicate and excitable. Is it
possible that anything occurred to upset
her?'</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus fixed his keen steel-gray
eyes on Doll. He had seen, as he saw
everything, Doll's momentary jealousy of
him the evening before.</p>

<p>For the life of him Doll could not think
what to say. It seemed impossible to tell
Mr. Loftus the truth, and he had but little
of that inventive talent which envious
persons with a small vocabulary call lying.
That little had been used up the night<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>
before. Yet, perhaps, if he had been
aware that Mr. Loftus had seen him with
Sibyl in the gallery in an attitude which
allowed of but few interpretations, his slow
mind might have grasped the nettly fact
that he must explain.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus waited.</p>

<p>'My boy,' he said at last, 'I am not
only Sibyl's husband'&mdash;he saw Doll wince&mdash;'but
I am also, I verily believe, her best
friend.'</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>A slight, almost imperceptible, change
came over Mr. Loftus's face. He paused
a moment, and then went on quietly:</p>

<p>'Sibyl is most generous about money&mdash;too
generous. I am almost afraid of taking
an unfair advantage of it, though she
presses me to do so. But I am pushing
on the repairs everywhere; and I am re<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>building
Greenfields and Springlands from
the ground. They will get to work again
directly the frost is over. I have the
plans here, if you would like to look at
them.'</p>

<p>He drew a roll out of the writing-table
drawer, and spread it on the table. Doll
perceived with intense relief that the subject
was dropped, and he knew Mr. Loftus
well enough to be certain that it would
never under any circumstances be reopened.
But as he looked at the plans,
and Mr. Loftus pointed out the new well
and the various advantages of the designs,
it dawned upon Doll's consciousness that
he was losing something which he had
always regarded as a secure possession,
and which nothing could replace&mdash;Mr.
Loftus's confidence.</p>

<p>He had seen it withdrawn in this gentle<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>
fashion from other people, who did not
find out for years afterwards that it was
irrevocably gone. And he became aware
that he could not bear to lose it.</p>

<p>'Here,' said Mr. Loftus, putting <a name="tn_png_157"></a><!--TN: "his" added after "on"-->on his
silver-rimmed pince-nez, 'is, or ought to
be, the new private road leading out on to
the H&mdash;&mdash; highroad. I decided to make
it, Doll, not only for the convenience of
the farm, but also because I cannot let
that row of cottages with any certainty
until there is an easier means of access to
them. My father always intended to make
a road there. I only hope,' he said at last,
letting the map fly back into a roll, 'that
I shall live to pay for all I am doing, but
I can't pay for unfinished contracts. If I
don't, Doll, you will have to raise a mortgage
on the property to pay for the actual
improvements on it. Sibyl has left all her<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>
fortune to me, I believe; but as I am
certain to go first, Wilderleigh will not be
the gainer.'</p>

<p>And it passed through Mr. Loftus's
mind for the first time that perhaps, after
all, Sibyl might still marry Doll some day.
How he had once wished for that marriage
he remembered with a sigh.</p>

<p>'It may be. Youth turns to youth,'
said Mr. Loftus to himself, as he went
up to his wife's room after Doll had left.</p>

<p>Sibyl was ill. A chill, or a shock, or
excitement&mdash;who shall say which?&mdash;had
just touched the delicate balance of her
health and overset it. It toppled over
suddenly without warning, without any of
the preliminary struggles by which a
strong constitution or a strong will staves
off the advance of illness. She gave way
entirely and at once, and the night after<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>
the night of the ball it would have been
difficult to recognise, in the sunk, colourless
face and motionless figure, the brilliant,
lovely young girl in her little diamond
crown.</p>

<p>Sibyl's illness did not prove dangerous,
but it was long. Lady Pierpoint, who had
nursed her before, sent her daughters home,
and took her place again by the bedside,
with the infinite patience which she had
learned in helping her husband down the
valley towards the death which at last
became the one goal of all their longing,
and which had receded before them with
every toiling step towards it, till they had
both wept together because he could not,
could not die. Perhaps it was because
her husband had gone through the slow
mill of consumption that Lady Pierpoint's
heart had so much tenderness for Sibyl,<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>
for whom only a year ago she had dreaded
the same fate.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus had the nervous horror of,
and repugnance to, every form of illness
which as often accompanies a refined and
sympathetic nature as it does an obtuse
and selfish one. And his lonely existence
had not brought him into contact with that
inevitable side of domestic life. He was
extraordinarily ignorant about it, and his
natural impulse was to avoid it.</p>

<p>But he stood by his wife's bedside, adjusted
his pince-nez, and accepted the
situation. For many days Sibyl would
take nothing unless given it by himself,
would rouse herself for no voice but his.
Lady Pierpoint marvelled to see him come
into Sibyl's room at night in his long gray
dressing-gown, to administer the food or
medicine which the nurse put into his<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>
hand. His patience and his kindness did
not flag, but it seemed to Lady Pierpoint
as if at this eleventh hour they should not
have been demanded of him; and it
wounded her&mdash;why, it would be hard to
say&mdash;to watch him do for Sibyl with painstaking
care the little things which in her
own youth her young husband had done
for her, the little things which in wedded
life are the great things.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus sometimes made a mistake,
and once he forgot that he was married,
and was found pacing in the rose-garden
oblivious of everything except a political
crisis&mdash;but only once. He was faithful in
that which is least.</p>

<p>Lady Pierpoint felt with a twinge of
conscience that when she had endeavoured
to bring about this marriage she had been<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>
selfishly engrossed in Sibyl's welfare. She
had not thought enough of his.</p>

<p>And gradually Sibyl recovered, and went
about the house again, wan and feeble,
and Lady Pierpoint left Wilderleigh.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstwords">Convalescence</span> is often accompanied by a
depression of spirits rarely experienced
during the illness itself. A weak nature
seeks for a cause for this depression in its
surroundings, and when it finds one, as it
invariably does, it hugs it. These causes,
thanks to the assiduity of one whom we
are given to understand has seen better
days, are seldom far to seek; and it
requires a very strong will to hold fast
the conviction that these paroxysms of de<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>pression
arise from physical weakness, and
not from some secret woe. Sibyl had not
a very strong will. After the first novelty
of convalescence was past, and she had
been installed in her sitting-room in a
cascade of lace and ribbons, which her
dressmaker called a <i>saut du lit</i>, and after
Mr. Loftus had gravitated back towards
the library on the ground-floor and his
article for the <i>Millennium</i>, Sibyl began
to experience that vague weariness and
distaste of life which all know who know
ill health.</p>

<p>It is at this stage that the unprincipled
invalid becomes 'the terror of the household
and its shame.' It is at this stage
that lengths of felt are laid down in
passages by tender and injudicious parents,
because no sound can be borne by
sensitive ears, that the children are<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>
'hushed,' the blinds are drawn down, and
doctors who encourage exercise and light
are speedily discovered to have misunderstood
the delicate constitution with which
they have to deal.</p>

<p>If Sibyl had not had a cause for
depression, she would most certainly have
manufactured one. But unfortunately she
had a real one. The incident of the
masked ball rankled. Doll had lied. He
had done his poor best, but he had not
lied well. His eyes had not quite looked
her in the face when he told her that Mr.
Loftus had married her for love. His
voice had not that emphatic ring which
the crude mind ever recognises as the ring
of truth, and which in consequence the
progressive one applies itself to acquire.</p>

<p>Her mind, dulled by illness and
narcotics, had half forgotten that she had<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>
been momentarily distressed. But now
the remembrance came back like a nightmare.
The grain of sand, blown by
chance into her eye, pricked, and she
sedulously rubbed it into an inflammation.</p>

<p>She remembered now that there had
been an earlier incident in his courtship
which had not been satisfactorily explained,
<i>when he proposed to her the second time</i>.
Sibyl always regarded his offer under the
mountain-ash as <i>the second time</i>. She had
a vague feeling that he had proposed
before. She had said as much to one or
two friends in confidence. But now that
she came to think of it, she remembered
that it was she who had proposed <i>the first
time</i>, and had been refused. This minor
detail of an uncomfortable incident had
until now almost slipped out of her
memory, which, like that of many women<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>
whose buoyancy depends on the conviction
of the admiration of others, seldom
harboured anything likely to prove a
worm in that bud.</p>

<p>But now she applied to the whole
subject that mental friction which morbid
minds believe to be reflection, until it
became, so to speak, inflamed.</p>

<p>Why had he sworn before the altar and
the Bishop to love her, if he did not
love her? She became tearful, listless,
apathetic. She sat for hours looking into
the fire, unemployed, uninterested. The
evil spirit which ever lurks in sofas and
couches whispered in her ear, when it
pressed the cushions, that she was indeed
miserable, that her husband avoided her,
that she was an unloved martyr, that no
one felt for her or sympathized with her.
It did not tell her that she had been<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>
married for her money, simply because no
sane person could look at Mr. Loftus and
believe that. But she changed in manner
towards him. She was cold, formal. She
turned away her head when he came into
the room, and then when he had left it
wept in secret because she had been
married out of pity.</p>

<p>And yet in her heart of hearts, if she
had such a thing, had she not partly
guessed that fact long ago, and wilfully
shut her eyes to it? The chance words
she had overheard were only the confirmation
of a latent misgiving. Does any
woman ever really remain in ignorance if
she is not loved, or if she has been
married for other reasons than love?
What constant props and supports she had
given to Mr. Loftus's love for her! It
had never been allowed to stand alone.<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>
Why had she from the first always
bolstered it up by continually saying to
herself and others, until she almost believed
it: 'My husband is so devoted to
me. My love is such a little thing beside
his. What have I done to deserve such a
great devotion?' How often she had said all
these things that tepidly-loved women say!</p>

<p>Seeming to observe nothing, Mr. Loftus
saw all, and pondered over the reason of
her altered appearance, and her visibly
changed feeling towards himself since the
night of the masked ball. If it were that
her health was threatened as it had been
before her marriage, why should her
affection towards himself have undergone
this change? Could it be anything to do
with Doll? And in these days Sibyl was
more frequently in his thoughts than in the
early days of his marriage with her. The<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>
thought of her came between him and the
political article which the editor of the
<i>Millennium</i> had asked for.</p>

<p>'Time will show,' he would say to
himself, with a sigh, taking up his pen
again.</p>

<p>One afternoon soon afterwards he came
into her sitting-room, and found her in
tears.</p>

<p>'Has Crack said anything unkind?' he
asked gently, while Crack beat his tail in
the depths of the fur rug in courteous
recognition of his own name.</p>

<p>'No,' she said, turning her head away.</p>

<p>'Have I, then?' sitting down by
her.</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Then, my child, what is it?'</p>

<p>'Nothing,' she said faintly.</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>

<p>'Is it the same nothing that troubled
you the night of the ball?'</p>

<p>He saw her start and shrink away from
him.</p>

<p>'Oh! did Doll tell you?' she gasped,
turning crimson.</p>

<p>'My dear, he told me nothing,' said Mr.
Loftus gently, moving slightly away from
her, and looking at her with grave attention.
He greatly feared that unhappiness was
before her in some form or other. He
waited in the hope that she would speak
to him of her own accord. But she only
began to cry again. She was still weak.
Was it possible that she was afraid of him?
What could be troubling her that she, who
did not know what reticence meant, could
fear to tell him, which yet Doll knew?
Doll was in love with her. Had he lost
his head on the night of the ball? Had<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>
she discovered that she and Doll were
young?</p>

<p>'Crack,' said Mr. Loftus, 'I have a very
neglectful wife. I come to ask for something
for my headache, and she pays no
attention to me at all.'</p>

<p>In earlier days Sibyl would have been
on the alert in a moment if Mr. Loftus's
sacred head confessed an ache. Now she
moved slowly to the writing-table and
produced certain innocuous remedies which
he had brought to her and asked her to
apply for him after that terrible time when
he had had an attack of the heart and had
repulsed her.</p>

<p>Presently the headache was better, and
Mr. Loftus went back to the library and
lit his pipe, which was remarkable, because
he was as a rule unable to smoke after a
headache.</p>

<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>

<p>He sat motionless a long time, his eyes
fixed.</p>

<p>'I hope,' he said at last, knocking the
ashes out of his pipe, 'that I shall not live
to become Sibyl's natural enemy, for I
think I am about the only real friend she
has in the world.'</p>

<p>And the small seed that would have
quickened in another man's heart into a
deep-rooted jealousy remained upon the
surface of his mind as a misgiving, which
took the form of anxiety for her.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstwords">Sibyl</span> continued pale and listless, and
presently Mr. Loftus found fault with her
gowns. They were not new enough. The
colours of her tea-gowns did not suit her.
He suggested that she should go to
London to Lady Pierpoint's house for a
few days to see her dressmaker, and added,
as an afterthought, that he should like her<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>
to consult the specialist to whom she had
gone on former occasions, and whose name
he had reason to remember.</p>

<p>Sibyl received the suggestion of this
visit in silence. She did not oppose herself
to it, but left the room to shed a torrent of
angry tears in private. The truth, which
seldom visited her feeble judgment, did
not tell her that Mr. Loftus was anxious
about her health. Hysteria took up the
tale instead, and officiously informed her
that he was tired of her. He wanted to
get rid of her. Men were always like that
after they had been married a little time.
What was a woman's love and devotion to
them when the first novelty had worn off?
She would go. She would certainly go;
and when she was gone she would write to
him, telling him that she saw only too
plainly that his love for her was dead,<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>
and that she had decided never to return,
and at the same time making over to him
her entire fortune, reserving only for herself
a pittance, on which she would live in
seclusion in a cottage in some remote
locality.</p>

<p>She was somewhat consoled as she
thought over the dignified, the harrowing
letter which she would compose in London.
Parts of it, as she repeated them to herself,
moved her to tears. A new sullenness
was added to the previous listlessness of
her demeanour. She parted from Mr.
Loftus with studied indifference.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus missed her, not altogether
unpleasantly, when she left him. It was
the first time that she had been a day
away from him since their marriage. Life
was certainly very tranquil without her.
He wrote her a charming little letter<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>
every day of the three days she was
away.</p>

<p>Doll was with him on business. Now
that Sibyl was absent, something of the
old affection and confidence returned
between them, which shrank away in her
presence; but not quite all. At times, as
they were talking, the younger man longed
to break down the slight, almost imperceptible
barrier that his stupid untimely
silence had raised. But he could not do
it. He could not take the plunge. Mr.
Loftus, however, who would not have done
such a thing for worlds, unwittingly gave
him a push.</p>

<p>'The spring coppice wants thinning,' he
said to Doll the third morning. 'We will
go up and mark the trees this afternoon.'</p>

<p>'I am going away to-day,' said Doll
sullenly.</p>

<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>

<p>'Stay another day,' said Mr. Loftus.
'Mrs. Gresley tells me that the sight of
her happy home, and Mr. Gresley, and the
church-tower as viewed from the spare
bedroom of the Vicarage, have proved a
turning-point in the lives of many wild
young men. Stay another day, Doll, and
I will emulate Mrs. Gresley. It will do
you good.'</p>

<p>'Uncle George,' stammered the young
man with sudden anger, 'will you never,
never understand? Have you forgotten
that it is not a year ago since I told you&mdash;in
this very room&mdash;and you said you would
help me. I can't meet Sibyl; and&mdash;and
she is coming back to-day. I tried in the
winter, and&mdash;it was a failure.'</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus had momentarily forgotten
Sibyl, as he had done once before when
she was ill.</p>

<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>

<p>'I beg your pardon, Doll,' he said, his
pale face reddening. 'I ought to have
remembered.'</p>

<p>There was a constrained silence.</p>

<p>'It need not come between us,' said
Mr. Loftus at last. 'You must not let it
do that.'</p>

<p>'I can't help it,' said Doll. 'It does.
It must.'</p>

<p>'Sibyl's happiness,' said Mr. Loftus
sadly, 'seems to be a costly article. A
great deal has been spent upon it, apparently
without making it secure. If we
have any real regard for her, we must
manage to save that between us, Doll,
whatever else goes by the board.'</p>

<p>'What do you take me for?' said Doll
fiercely.</p>

<p>'A good man,' said Mr. Loftus, 'and
the person I care for most in the world.'</p>

<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>

<p>Sibyl's letter to Mr. Loftus was never
written. At least it was written, as, indeed,
were several, and read over and
retouched at night in her own room; but
even the best of the assortment remained
unposted. Sibyl brought back her wan
face and limp figure to Wilderleigh a few
hours after Doll had left it, and heard with
bitterness that he had been staying there.
She had pictured to herself Mr. Loftus
alone, missing her at every moment of the
day, realizing the withdrawal of the sunshine
of her presence. This was a 'high
jump,' on the bar of which, it must be
owned, even her practised imagination
caught its toe. And now she found that
Doll had been with him all the time&mdash;Doll,
whom he cared for more than for
his wife. He had not missed her, after all.
Probably he and Doll had been discussing<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>
her. She had been jealous of Doll ever
since she had seen Mr. Loftus take his
arm during her first visit to Wilderleigh
before she was married.</p>

<p>Her jealousy revived now. For the
remainder of the day Sibyl met Mr.
Loftus with averted eyes and monosyllabic
answers, rehearsing in her mind parting
scenes with him which were to prove more
poignantly distressing to him than the best
of the letters, and in which he was to
appeal in vain (imagination caught its
toe once more) against her irrevocable
determination to leave for ever one who
had married her for other motives than
love.</p>

<p>She could see herself in evening dress,
pale as the jasmine flower in her breast,
mournful but unflinching, withdrawing her
hand, and saying, in reply to the moving<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>
representation which he would of course
make of his loneliness:</p>

<p>'You have Doll!'</p>

<p>She decided that she would not say
more than that. No reproach should pass
her lips.</p>

<p>'You have Doll!'</p>

<p>What words for a young wife to be
forced to use to her husband! Her hands
clenched in an agony of self-pity. What a
cruel situation was hers!</p>

<p>So Sibyl walked in her waking dream,
and her husband watched her.</p>

<p>'Is it the body that is ill, or is it the
mind?' he asked himself.</p>

<p>Later in the day the doctor's letter to
himself&mdash;Mr. Loftus had written to him
asking for a frank statement of Sibyl's
condition&mdash;confirmed his worst fears for
her.</p>

<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>

<p>'Mrs. Loftus's health is endangered, not
by her recent illness, of which no trace
appears, but by some anxiety. She does
not deny that she is suffering from great
depression. Unless that anxiety, whatever
it may be, can be removed, her
morbid condition, if prolonged, will give
rise to grave apprehension as to her
future.'</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus had heard something very
like this before&mdash;about nine months ago.
He had removed a mountain in order to
remove with it the first cause of her unhappiness,
and now unhappiness had reappeared.
No one had guessed&mdash;no one
had been allowed to guess&mdash;what an effort
his marriage had been to him. And it
had availed nothing. He dropped the
letter into the fire, and, as he did so, exhaustion
and an intense weariness of life<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>
laid hold upon him. He knew well the
touch of those stern hands, but this evening,
as he sat alone in the library, it
seemed to him as if he had never endured
their full pressure until now.</p>

<span class="i0">O these last steps on which I climb.'<br></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap keepright">Shelley.</span><br></span>
</div>
</div>


<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstwords">For</span> those who do not sleep, life has two
sides&mdash;the side of night as well as day&mdash;and
the heaviest hour of the day or night
is the hour before the dawn, when the
night-lamp totters and dies, and the ashen
light of another day falls like despair on
the familiar articles of furniture, the chairs,
the table, the wardrobe, which have been
up all night like ourselves, taking the imprint
of our exhaustion through the interminable
hours, and which look older and<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>
more haggard than ever in the changed
light which brings nor change nor rest.</p>

<p>Those who sleep at night, for whom
each day is not divided by a gulf of pain,
who look upon the darkness as a time of
rest, and the morning as a time of waking,
know one side of life, perhaps, as the
passers-by in the street know one side of
the hospital as they skirt it&mdash;the outside
wall.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus slept ill, and the night after
Sibyl's return he woke early. The gray
light was just showing above the white
blinds as he had seen it so many, many
times. Would the morning ever come, he
wondered, when he should no longer open
his eyes upon the dawn, when 'these last
steps' should be climbed, and effort would
cease, and weariness might lie down and
cease also?</p>

<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>

<p>The premonitory tremor, the shudder
of coming illness, laid its hand upon him,
and with it came that physical recoil of
the flesh from solitude before which the
strongest will goes down.</p>

<p>Involuntarily he got up and went to
Sibyl's room. He opened the door noiselessly
and looked in.</p>

<p>The room felt deserted. He went up
to the bed; it was empty. A great fear fell
upon him. Had she left him? Poor, poor
child! had she left him, as that other wife
had left him in the half-forgotten past,
buried beneath so many years? Can any
man whose wife has forsaken him ever
quite forget that he has once been deserted,
that the road which leads away
from him has known a woman's footsteps,
and another may walk in it? He stood
still and listened. The spirit had over-<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>mastered
the flesh. All suffering had
vanished.</p>

<p>From the next room, Sibyl's sitting-room,
which opened out of her bedroom,
a faint sound came. He noiselessly
crossed, and looked through the half-open
door, and thanked God.</p>

<p>Sibyl was lying on her face on the
polished floor in her night-gown, moaning
and sobbing, a white blot upon the dark
boards.</p>

<p>He had seen her lie like that once
before, among the bracken in the park, in
the entire abandonment of young despair.
The vague suspicion of many weeks
dropped its disguise, and stood revealed,
an awful figure between them, between
the old man in his gray hair and the
young, young wife.</p>

<p>He withdrew stealthily, regained his<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>
own room, and sat down in the armchair.</p>

<p>That passion of tears could flow from
one source only. He knew Sibyl well
enough to know that she had no tears,
no strong emotion, for anything except
that which affected her own personal
happiness. Her slight nature could not
reach to impersonal love, any more than
it could reach to righteous anger. All
this apparent failure of health and listlessness
had a mental cause, as he had
always feared, as he now knew for certain.
She was unhappy.</p>

<p>'She has ceased to love me,' said
Mr. Loftus to himself, 'and she is in
despair. Doll loves her, and she has
found it out. Those tears are for Doll.'</p>

<p>There was a long pause of thought.</p>

<p>He started at the remembrance that<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>
she was probably still lying on the floor
in her thin night-gown.</p>

<p>He got up, and tapped distinctly at the
door of her bedroom. At first there was
no reply, but after the second time there
was a slight hurried movement and a faint
'Come in.' He went in. She had crept
back into bed, as he had hoped she would
at the sound of his tap.</p>

<p>'May I have your salts?' he said, taking
them from the dressing-table. 'I have
waked with a headache.'</p>

<p>'Can I do anything for it?' she asked,
but without moving, her miserable eyes
following his thin, gaunt figure in its gray
dressing-gown.</p>

<p>'Nothing, my dear, except forgive me
for disturbing you.'</p>

<p>'I was not asleep,' said Sibyl, yielding
to the impulse, irresistible to some women,<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>
to approach the subject which they are
trying to conceal.</p>

<p>He took the salts, and went back to
his own room, closing the door carefully.
But he did not use them. He sighed
heavily as he sat down again in the old
armchair in which he had so often watched
the light grow behind the Welsh hills.</p>

<p>There was another pause of thought,
and he remembered again Doll's confession
of the day before.</p>

<p>'Poor children!' he said&mdash;'poor children!'</p>

<p>And he remembered his own youth and
its devastating passions, and the woman
whom he had loved in middle life, and
how nearly once&mdash;how nearly&mdash;&mdash; And
he and she had been stronger than Doll
and Sibyl.</p>

<p>'God forgive me!' he said; 'I meant
well.'</p>

<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>'I knew her love could not last,' his
mind went on. 'It was too extravagant,
and it had no foundation. But I thought
it would last my time, and it has not. I
have outlived it; I am in the way.'</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus had never willingly been in
the way of anyone before. His tact had
so far saved him. But a kind intention
had betrayed him at last.</p>

<p>'I am in the way,' he repeated, 'and I
am fond of them both, and I think they
are both fond of me. But they will come
to hate me.'</p>

<p>The light was strong and white now,
and a butterfly on the window-sill, that
had mistaken spring for summer, waked,
and began to beat its wings against the
pane.</p>

<p>He rose wearily, and opened the old-<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>fashioned
window wide upon its hinges.
The butterfly flew away into the spring
morning.</p>

<p>'My other butterfly,' he said&mdash;'my
pretty butterfly, who mistook the spring
for summer, breaking your heart against
the prison windows of my worn-out life&mdash;I
will release you, too!'</p>

<p>He took up the little silver flask that
always stood on his dressing-table at night
and lived in his pocket by day, and which
contained the only remedy which a great
doctor could find for his attacks of the
heart, by means of which he had been till
now kept in life.</p>

<p>'I have a right to do it,' he said. 'I
can only help them by going away. And
if I am in the wrong, upon my head
be it.'</p>

<p>He checked himself in the act of empty<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>ing
the contents of the flask into the dead
fire.</p>

<p>'A right?' he said. 'What right have
I to shirk the consequences of my own
actions? what right to be a coward?
No; I will not go away until I receive
permission to do so. I will stay while it is
required of me.'</p>

<p>He sighed heavily, and replaced the
flask upon the dressing-table.</p>

<p>'Patience,' he said. 'I thought I had
seen the last of you. I am tired of you.
But, nevertheless, I must put up with you
a little longer.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">'As the water is dried upon sands, so a life flieth
back to the dust.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir Alfred Lyall.</span></p>


<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstwords">How</span> Sibyl spent the morning that followed
she never knew. She dared not go out of
doors. The world of spring, with the new
breath of life in it, mocked her. The
song of the birds hurt her. She felt as if
she should scream outright if she saw the
may-blossom against the sky. She wandered
aimlessly about the house, and at
last crept back to her own room and lay
down on her bed, and turned her face to
the wall.</p>

<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>

<p>The day went on. Her maid brought
her soup, and drew down the blinds, and
was pettishly dismissed.</p>

<p>The afternoon came. They were mowing
the grass on the terrace on the south
front. The faint scent of newly-cut grass
came in through the open window, and
seemed, through the senses, to reach some
acute nerve of the brain. She moaned,
and buried her face in the pillows. Presently
the mowing ceased, and everything
became very silent. A bluebottle fly,
pressed for time, rushed in, made the
circuit of the room, and rushed out again.</p>

<p>Far away in the other wing, on the
ground-floor, she heard the library door
open. She knew Mr. Loftus's slow, even
step. It crossed the hall; it entered the
orangery; it came out through the
orangery door, down the stone steps to<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>
the terrace below her window. She could
hear his step on the gravel outside in the
crisp air. Crack gave a short bark in
recognition of the spring, and satisfaction
that the long morning of arranging papers
and the afternoon of letter-writing were
at last over.</p>

<p>The steps dwindled and died away into
the sunny silence. It seemed to Sibyl's
overwrought mind that he was walking
slowly out of her life, and that unless she
made haste to follow him she would lose
him altogether. With a sudden revulsion
of feeling, she sprang to her feet, and put
on her hat and shoes. Then she braved
the spring, and went swiftly out.</p>

<p class="fivestar center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>A great tranquillity had fallen upon
Mr. Loftus. He had made up his mind.
After a turn along the terrace, he and<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>
Crack went into the little wood near the
gardens, and sat down under the pink
horse-chestnut-tree, just blushing into
flower. It would have been difficult to
put the arrangement into words, but there
was a tacit understanding between the
husband and wife that when Mr. Loftus
sat under that particular tree he did not
mind being interrupted. Sibyl generally
fluttered out to him after he had been
there a few minutes, though the wood was
out of sight of the windows. And he
waited for her to come to him now.</p>

<p>Spring had returned at last. But you
might have walked through the wood and
not known she was there: have seen only
the naked trees, and the gray twigs of the
alder, bleached white where the rabbits
had bitten them in the frost. But if you
had stopped to listen and look as Mr.<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>
Loftus did, you would have seen and
heard her; seen her in the blue haze, and
the mystery of change that lurked among
the gray twigs, and in the rare primroses
among the brown leaves; heard her in the
persistent double-tongue of the chiff-chaff,
and, not near at hand, but two trees away,
in the ripple of the goldfinch, with a little
question at the end of it. Is it a hint of
immortality, that haunting desire and expectation
of happiness which comes with
the primroses, that longing for some future
year when the spring shall bring with it
no heartache, the autumn no contrition; of
another year, somewhere in the future,
when the ills of life will be done away?
Mr. Loftus looked straight in front of him,
and his face took an expression as of one
whose eyes are on a goal where even
patience itself, so visible in every line of<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>
his quiet face, will at last with other
burdens be laid aside.</p>

<p>She saw him before he saw her, as she
came towards him. Her heart went out
to him wistfully and passionately by turns.
She longed to turn to him as a young wife
turns to a young husband, and cry her
heart out on his breast, and be petted, and
caressed, and comforted. But she dared
not. Whatever besides she was ignorant
of, she had learnt certain things about her
husband, and one of them was that she
must never show her devotion unasked.
And she was seldom asked. Her life was
a constant repression of its greatest, its
only real affection.</p>

<p>As she came towards him he roused
himself and smiled at her. She sat down
by him in silence. He had a single primrose
in the buttonhole of his coat, and he<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>
took it out and drew it very gently through
the Russian embroidery on her bodice.</p>

<p>'When I was young, Sibyl,' he said, 'I
was convinced, and the conviction has
never wholly left me, that flowers are
God's thoughts which He sows broadcast
in the hearts of all alike. But we will
have none of them, and they drop unheeded
to the ground. But the faithful
earth receives them&mdash;thoughts despised
and rejected of us&mdash;and nurses them in
her bosom, and they come forth transfigured.
And that is why, when we see
them again, we love them so much, and
feel akin to them.'</p>

<p>Her locked hands trembled on her
knee.</p>

<p>'It must have been a beautiful thought
that could turn into a lily,' he went on,
noting, but ignoring, her emotion. 'I<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>
wonder, if it had fallen into a poet's heart,
what it would have grown into. Nothing
more beautiful, I think. And I know the
primroses are first love. I have felt sure
of that always. I wonder, my Sibyl,
when there is so much in your heart for
me, that there are any left to come out in
the woods; but there are a few, you see,
among the brown leaves.'</p>

<p>'They will soon be over,' said Sibyl,
turning her head away.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Mr. Loftus, with a gentleness
which was new to Sibyl, and he was
always gentle. 'They will die presently,
as first love dies. But nevertheless it is a
beautiful gift while it lasts, and we must
not grieve because, like the primroses, it
cannot last in flower <i>for ever</i>. I have
lived through so many feelings, Sibyl, I
have seen so many die which seemed<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>
immortal, that I have long since ceased to
count on the permanence of any.'</p>

<p>He leant towards her, and for the first
time he took her slender hands and kissed
them. It was as if he were readjusting
his position towards her, reassuring her of
his trust and confidence and sympathy,
supporting her in some great trouble. She
leaned her forehead against his shoulder,
and a sense of comfort came across her
desolation, as if she were leaning her faint
soul against his soul. He put his arm
round her, and drew her closer to him.</p>

<p>'My darling!' he said, and there was an
emotion in his voice which she had never
heard in it before. Her hat had slipped
off, and he passed his hand very tenderly
over her hair.</p>

<p>Sibyl's over-strained nerves relaxed.
Some of the craving of her heart and its<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>
long yearning was stilled by the touch of
his hand. Ah! he loved her, after all&mdash;certainly
he loved her. Doll was right,
after all. How foolish she had been to
cry all night! Certainly he loved her.</p>

<p>She could not speak. She could not
weep. She could only lean against him.
She had never known him like this before.
It was this that she had always wanted, all
her life, long before she had ever met
him.</p>

<p>'You have been so good to me,' he
went on, 'from the first day of our married
life when I was ill. Do you remember?
And I know that your dear love and kindness
will not fail me while I live. I thank
and bless you for all you have given me,
your whole spring of primroses; and now
that spring is passing, as it must, Sibyl, as
it must, not by your fault, take comfort,<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>
and when other feelings come into your
heart, as they have come in, do not
reproach yourself, do not cut me to the
heart by grieving, but remember that I
understand, and that my love and honour
and gratitude can never change towards
you, and that I too was young once: as
young as&mdash;Doll, and there is no need
for you and him to be so miserable.
It will only be&mdash;like a&mdash;long engagement.'</p>

<p>As the drift of his words gradually
became clear to her, Sibyl insensibly
shrank back as from an abyss before her
feet. But in another moment she took in
their whole meaning. She pushed him
from her with sudden violence, and stood
before him, her hands clenched, her eyes
blazing, her slender figure shaking with
passion.</p>

<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>

<p>'How dare you!' she stammered. 'How
dare you insult me?'</p>

<p>He put out his hand feebly, and she
struck it down.</p>

<p>'What is Doll to me?' she went on, 'to
me, <i>your wife</i>! Oh, will you never,
never understand that I love you, that I
worship you, that I care for nothing in the
whole world but you, and that I cried all
night because you married me out of pity?'
Sibyl wrung her hands. 'Oh! how dared
you do it, how dared you swear to love me
before God, if you did not, if you could
not? I am too miserable. I cannot bear
it&mdash;I cannot bear it!'</p>

<p>He sat like one stunned. His hand
went to his heart.</p>

<p>In a moment her arms were round him,
and his head was on her shoulder.</p>

<p>'Forgive,' he repeated over and over<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>
again, between the long-drawn gasps
which shook him from head to foot.</p>

<p>And then the battle for life began.</p>

<p>She found his little flask in his pocket,
and managed to make him swallow the
contents.</p>

<p>He struggled, but she upheld him. Her
strength was as the strength of ten.</p>

<p>At last, all in a moment, the struggle
ceased, and a light came into his fixed eyes
of awe and thankfulness, and&mdash;was it joy?</p>

<p>He did not move. He did not speak.
His whole being seemed absorbed in that
of some vast enfolding presence.</p>

<p>She called him wildly by name.</p>

<p>He trembled, and his troubled eyes,
with all the light blown out of them,
wandered back to seek hers. Death
looked at her through them. He saw
her as across a gulf. He recognised her.<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>
He remembered. He had hoped that
when he came to die it might be quietly,
without a scene, but it was not to be. He
made a last effort.</p>

<p>'Not for pity&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;' he gasped, his
ebbing breath winnowing the air. But
Death cut short the lie faltering on his
lips, and his head fell suddenly forward on
her breast. She held him closely to her,
murmuring incoherent words of love and
tenderness, such as she had never dared to
speak while he had ears to hear.</p>

<p class="fivestar center">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>How long she had knelt beside him,
holding him in her arms, the frightened
servants, who at last found them after sunset,
never knew. And when they came to
lay him in his coffin, they saw on one of
the thin folded hands a faint blue mark, as
from a blow.</p>

<h2><a name="POSTSCRIPT" id="POSTSCRIPT">POSTSCRIPT.</a></h2>


<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstwords">Sibyl</span> was an inconsolable widow. Her
grief reached a depth which placed her
beyond the succour of human sympathy,
and Lady Pierpoint, who had lost her
young husband in her youth, was felt to
take a superficial view of Sibyl's bereavement.</p>

<p>She shut herself up at Wilderleigh
for a year and refused comfort, and then
suddenly married Doll, the only man
except Mr. Gresley whom she had allowed
to see her during her widowhood.</p>

<p>In rather less than a month after her<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>
marriage with him she made the interesting
discovery that he was the only man in
the world who really understood her. His
gift of platitude, harmonizing as it did
with hers, was an inexhaustible source of
admiration to her. She was wont to say
in confidence to her woman friends, that,
devotedly as she had loved her first
husband, she had found her ideal in her
second one; and that it was to Doll she
owed the real development of her character,
a subject in which she took great
interest.</p>

<p>For some years, while her daughter
remained an only child, she was passionately
devoted to her. But when her
son was born she ceased to take much
interest in the little girl, who was by this,
time rather spoilt, and consequently tiresome.
Doll, who proved exemplary in<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>
domestic life, took to her when Sibyl forgot
her, and became deeply attached to her.
Later in life Sibyl became inconsolably
jealous of her daughter.</p>

<p class="reviewer">Saturday Review.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'From first to last it goes with immense vigour and sympathy.
But the story must be read for its power to be understood; quotation
fails, for the simple reason that it is a bare story and nothing
beyond. Apart from its distinctive qualities, English readers will
welcome this book as an indication of the growth of a real and independent
critical method across the Atlantic, side by side and directing
really original work.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">'A striking scene of the relations, in a rough world, between a boy

<p class="reviewer">Speaker.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Stephen Crane proved conclusively in "The Red Badge of
Courage" his possession of an extraordinary power of vivid and
accurate vision expressed with startling poignancy of phrase; and
in his later production, "George's Mother," we find the same rugged
directness and almost savage intensity, the same contempt for conventional
graces of style, and the love for violent colouring, which
marked his previous work.'</p>

enough cause it to lie unnoticed among its thrilling companions.
There is, none the less, more of art and literature in two short
sketches than one is likely to meet with again in a hurry. If inferior
work, gaudily bedraped, gets all the encores, in the shape of many
editions, I cannot think she will greatly care. Such work as hers
only comes, as the proverb has it, by prayer and fasting. And she

<p class="blockquot">'Certainly one of the most interesting and valuable works of
fiction issued from the press for a long time past. Even if we were
to regard the book as an ordinary novel, we could commend it
heartily; but its great value lies in the fact that it reveals to us a
hidden world, and does so with manifest fidelity. But the reader
must learn for himself the lesson which this remarkable and
fascinating book teaches.'</p>


<p class="reviewer">Daily Chronicle.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'A Turkish love story written in excellent English by a young
Ottoman lady, would be a book worth reading, if only as a curiosity;
but when, as in this instance, it is of uncommon merit and originality,
it is particularly welcome. It is deeply interesting, fascinatingly so.
It is as a picture of family life in Turkey that this book
is so interesting, possibly because the picture it provides is unexpectedly
agreeable. As a study of Turkish life in our times, when
Western civilization is beginning to penetrate into the seclusion of
the harem, this book is a valuable contribution to contemporary
literature. It is a well-merited compliment to its author to say of
"Hadjira" that it is one of the best stories of the season.'</p>


<p class="reviewer">Pall Mall Gazette.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'An interesting and readable book.'</p>


<p class="reviewer">St. James's Gazette.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'"A Reluctant Evangelist" is as good as its predecessor

<p class="reviewer">Pall Mall Gazette.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'Good, too, is Miss Spinner's budget of short stories. "Buckra
Tommie" is an exquisitely pathetic story. The writer is evidently
at home in the South Seas, and with the out-of-the-way humanity
she meets there.'</p>

she portrays men and women, and describes the passions of love or
of grief that sometimes fill the mind. There are other personages
in these pages, whose experiences of love and joy and grief are

had depicted none other than the three personages that appear in
the tragic scene in London she would have scored a distinct success.
An admirably-written book.'</p>


<p class="reviewer">Sheffield Telegraph.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'We have not read anything so tenderly touched with pathos,
and at the same time so delicately told, for a very long time. Indeed,
"Interludes" is about as good a piece of literary work of its
class as we could wish to read, and is worth a high place in the works
which appeal to the emotional in our nature.'</p>


<p class="reviewer">Bradford Observer.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'The stories evince a considerable and disciplined faculty of

is that Lord Dunmore is a remarkably lucky man to lead such a
pleasant life among such charming people and in such charming
places, and that everybody will be delighted to hear from him again,
when he has more of the same sort to tell us, whether he wraps it up

who has done justice to him, and to do justice to M. Cherbuliez
is no mean achievement, for he is one of the most artistic and
delightful of modern French novelists. He is also one of the few
whose works may be safely left lying about where the young person

qualities are to be found.'</p>
